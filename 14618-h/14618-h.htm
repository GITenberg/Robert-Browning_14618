<p><i>DEAR OLD FRIEND,</i></p>

<p style="text-indent: 7em; line-height: 1.5em;"><i>A generation has
passed since the day when, in your study at Brackenbed
Grange, your reading of "Ben Ezra," the tones of which still vibrate in
my memory, first introduced me to the poetry of Robert Browning. He was
then just entering upon his wider fame. You had for years been one not
merely of the few who recognised him, but of those, yet fewer, who
proclaimed him. The standpoint of the following pages is not, I think,
very remote from your own; conversations with you have, in any case,
done something to define it. You see, then, that your share of
responsibility for them is, on all counts, considerable, and you must
not refuse to allow me to associate them with a name which the old
Rabbi's great heartening cry: "Strive, and hold cheap the strain, Learn,
nor account the pang, Dare, never grudge the throe," summons
spontaneously to many other lips than mine. To some it is brought yet
closer by his calm retrospect through sorrow.</i></p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p>BROWNING is confessedly a difficult poet, and his difficulty is by no
means all of the kind which opposes unmistakable impediments to the
reader's path. Some of it is of the more insidious kind, which may
co-exist with a delightful persuasion that the way is absolutely clear,
and Browning's "obscurity" an invention of the invertebrate. The
problems presented by his writing are merely tough, and will always
yield to intelligent and patient scrutiny. But the problems presented by
his mind are elusive, and it would be hard to resist the cogency of his
interpreters, if it were not for their number. The rapid succession of
acute and notable studies of Browning put forth during the last three or
four years makes it even more apparent than it was before that the last
word on Browning has not yet been said, even in that very qualified
sense in which the last word about any poet, or any poetry, can ever be
said at all. The present volume, in any case, does not aspire to say it.
But it is not perhaps necessary to apologise for adding, under these
conditions, another to the list. From most of the recent studies I have
learned something; but this book has its roots in a somewhat earlier
time, and may perhaps be described as an attempt to work out, in the
detail of Browning's life and poetry, from a more definitely literary
standpoint and without Hegelian prepossessions, a view of his genius not
unlike that set forth with so much eloquence and penetration, in his
well-known volume, by Professor Henry Jones. The narrative of Browning's
life, in the earlier chapters, makes no pretence to biographical
completeness. An immense mass of detail and anecdote bearing upon him is
now available and within easy reach. I have attempted to sift out from
this picturesque loose drift the really salient and relevant material.
Much domestic incident, over which the brush would fain linger, will be
missed; on the other hand, the great central epoch of Browning's poetic
life, from 1846 to 1869, has been treated, deliberately, on what may
appear an inordinately generous scale. Some amount of overlapping and
repetition, it may be added, in the analytical chapters the plan of the
book rendered it impossible wholly to avoid.</p>

<p>I am indebted to a friend, who wishes to be nameless, for reading the
proofs, with results extremely beneficial to the book.</p>

<p class="noindent">Judged by his cosmopolitan sympathies and his
encyclop&aelig;dic knowledge, by the scenery and the persons among whom
his poetry habitually moves, Browning was one of the least insular of
English poets. But he was also, of them all, one of the most obviously
and unmistakably English. Tennyson, the poetic mouthpiece of a rather
specific and exclusive Anglo-Saxondom, belonged by his Vergilian
instincts of style to that main current of European poetry which
<a name="page2" id="page2">finds</a> response and recognition
among cultivated persons of all nationalities; and he enjoyed a European
distinction not attained by any other English poet since Byron.
Browning, on the contrary, with his long and brilliant gallery of
European creations, Browning, who claimed Italy as his "university,"
remains, as a poet, all but unknown even in Italy, and all but
non-existent for the rest of the civilised world beyond the Channel. His
cosmopolitan sympathies worked through the medium of a singularly
individual intellect; and the detaching and isolating effect which
pronounced individuality of thinking usually produces, even in a genial
temperament, was heightened in his case by a robust indifference to
conventions of all kinds, and not least to those which make genius
easily intelligible to the plain man.</p>

<p>What is known of Browning's descent makes these contrasts in some
degree intelligible. An old strain of Wessex squires or yeomen, dimly
discernible in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, issued, about
the middle of the eighteenth, in the first distinct personality among
the poet's forebears, his grandfather, who also bore the name Robert. He
was a robust, hard-headed, energetic, pushing man of business and the
world, who made his way from a clerkship to an important and responsible
post in the Bank of England, and settled accounts with religion and with
literature in a right English way, by reading the Bible and 'Tom Jones'
through every year, and very little else. More
<a name="page3" id="page3">problematical</a> and elusive is the figure
of his first wife, Margaret Tittle, with whom, to judge from the
character of her eldest son, literary and artistic sensibility first
mingled in the hard practical Browning stock. In this second Robert
Browning, indeed, the somewhat brutal and grasping egotism
of the father gave place to a cultured humanity of almost feminine
tenderness and charm. All his life long he was passionately devoted to
literature, to art, to children. He collected rare books and prints with
avidity, but was no less generous in giving them away. Indifferent to
money, he hated to see a scrap of paper wasted. He had a neat touch in
epigrams, and a boyish delight in grotesque rhymes. But there was no
lack of grit in this accomplished, fresh-minded, and lovable man. He had
the tough fibre of his race; only it was the wrongs of others that
called out its tenacity, not his own. While holding an appointment on
his mother's West Indian estate, he braved the fierce resentment of the
whole colony by teaching a negro-boy to read; and finally incurred
disinheritance rather than draw a livelihood from slave-labour. This
Shelleyan act involved for him the resignation of his intellectual and
artistic ambitions; and with the docility characteristic of him, where
only his own interests were concerned, he forthwith entered the fairly
well-paid but unexciting service of the Bank.</p>

<p>In 1811 he married, and on May 7 of the following year his eldest son,
Robert, was born. His wife <a name="page4" id="page4">was</a> the
daughter of a German shipowner, William Wiedemann, who had settled and
married at Dundee. Wiedemann is said to have been an accomplished
draughtsman and musician, and his daughter, without herself sharing
these gifts, probably passed them on to her son. Whether she also
communicated from her Scottish and German ancestry the "metaphysical"
proclivities currently ascribed to him, is a hypothesis absolutely in
the air.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref1" id="fnref1"
href="#fn1">[1]</a></span> What is clear is that she was herself
intellectually simple and of few ideas, but rich in the temperament, at
once nervous and spiritual, which when present in the mother so often
becomes genius in the son. "She was a divine woman," such was her son's
brief sufficing tribute. Physically he seems to have closely resembled
her,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref2" id="fnref2"
href="#fn2">[2]</a></span> and they were bound together by a peculiarly
passionate love from first to last.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn1" id="fn1" href="#fnref1">[1]</a></span>
A similar but more groundless suggestion, that the author
of <i>Holy-cross Day</i> and <i>Rabbi ben Ezra</i> probably had Jewish
blood in his veins, can only be described as an impertinence&mdash;not to
Browning but to the Jewish race. As if to feel the spiritual genius of
Hebraism and to be moved by the pathos of Hebraic fate were an
eccentricity only to be accounted for by the bias of kin! It is
significant that his demonstrable share of German blood left him rather
conspicuously impervious to the literary&mdash;and more especially to the
"metaphysical"&mdash;products of the German mind.
<br /><br />
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn2" id="fn2" href="#fnref2">[2]</a></span>
Browning himself reports the exclamation of the family
doctor when trying to diagnose an attack of his: "Why, has anybody to
search far for a cause of whatever nervous disorder you may suffer
from, when there sits your mother&mdash;whom you so absolutely resemble!"

<p>The home in Camberwell into which the boy Robert
<a name="page5" id="page5">was</a> born reflected the
serene, harmonious, self-contented character of his parents. Friends
rarely disturbed the even tenor of its ways, and the storms of politics
seem to have intruded as faintly into this suburban seclusion as the
roar of London. Books, business, and religion provided a framework of
decorous routine within which these kindly and beautiful souls moved
with entire content. Well-to-do Camberwell perhaps contained few homes
so pure and refined; but it must have held many in which the life-blood
of political and social interests throbbed more vigorously, and where
thought and conversation were in closer touch with the intellectual life
of the capital and the larger movements of the time. Nothing in
Browning's boyhood tended to open his imagination to the sense of
citizenship and nationality which the imperial pageants and ceremonies
of Frankfurt so early kindled in the child Goethe. But within the limits
imposed by this quiet home young Robert soon began to display a vigour
and enterprise which tried all its resources. "He clamoured for
occupation from the moment he could speak," and "something to do" meant
above all some living thing to be caught for him to play with. The gift
of an animal was found a valuable aid to negotiations with the young
despot; when medicine was to be taken, he would name "a speckled frog"
as the price of his compliance, and presently his mother would be seen
hovering hither and thither among the strawberry-beds. A quaint
menagerie was gradually assembled: owls and monkeys, magpies
<a name="page6" id="page6">and</a> hedgehogs, an eagle and snakes.
Boy-collectors are often cruel; but Robert showed from the first an
anxious tenderness and an eager care for life: we hear of a hurt cat
brought home to be nursed, of ladybirds picked up in the depths of
winter and preserved with wondering delight at their survival. Even in
stories the death of animals moved him to bitter tears. He was equally
quick at books, and soon outdistanced his companions at the elementary
schools which he attended up to his fourteenth year. Near at hand, too,
was the Dulwich Gallery,&mdash;"a green half-hour's walk across the
fields,"&mdash;a beloved haunt of his childhood, to which he never
ceased to be grateful.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref3" id="fnref3"
href="#fn3">[3]</a></span> But his father's overflowing library and
portfolios played the chief part in his early development. He read
voraciously, and apparently without restraint or control. The letters of
Junius and of Horace Walpole were familiar to him "in boyhood," we are
assured with provoking indefiniteness by Mrs Orr; as well as "all the
works of Voltaire." Most to his mind, however, was the rich sinewy
English and athletic fancy of the seventeenth-century Fantastic Quarles;
a preference which foreshadowed his later delight in the great master of
the Fantastic school, and of all who care for close-knit intellect in
poetry, John Donne.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, it was some fragments of the grandiose but shadowy
Ossian which first stirred the imitative impulse in this poet of
trenchant and clear-cut form. "The first composition I ever was guilty
<a name="page7" id="page7">of</a>," he wrote to Elizabeth Barrett
(Aug. 25, 1846), "was something in imitation of Ossian, whom I had not
read, but conceived through two or three scraps in other books." And
long afterwards Ossian was "the first book I ever bought in my
life" (ib.) These "imitations" were apparently in verse, and in rhyme;
and Browning's bent and faculty for both was very early pronounced. "I
never can recollect not writing rhymes; ... but I knew they were
nonsense even then." And a well-known anecdote of his infancy describes
his exhibition of a lively sense of metre in verses which he recited
with emphatic accompaniments upon the edge of the dining-room table
before he was tall enough to look over it. The crowding thoughts of his
maturity had not yet supervened to prevent the abundant music that he
"had in him" from "getting out." It is not surprising that a boy of
these proclivities was captivated by the stormy swing and sweep of
Byron; nor that he should have caught also something of his "splendour
of language," and even, a little later, a reflection, respectable and
suburban enough, of his rebellious Titanism. The less so, that in
Robert's eleventh or twelfth year Byron, the head of the
Satanic school, had become the heroic champion of Greek liberation, and
was probably spoken of with honour in the home of the large-hearted
banker who had in his day suffered so much for the sake of the
unemancipated slave. In later years Browning was accustomed to deliver
himself of breezy sarcasms at the expense of the
<a name="page8" id="page8">"flat-fish"</a> who
declaimed so eloquently about the "deep and dark blue ocean." But it is
easy to see that this genial chaff covered a real admiration,&mdash;the
tribute of one abounding nature to another, which even years and the
philosophic mind did not seriously abate. "I always retained my first
feeling for Byron in many respects," he wrote in a significant letter to
Miss Barrett in 1846. " ... I would at any time have gone to Finchley to
see a curl of his hair or one of his gloves, I am sure,&mdash;while
Heaven knows that I could not get up enthusiasm enough to cross the room
if at the other end of it all Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey were
condensed into the little china bottle yonder."<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref4" id="fnref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></span>
It was thus no mere freak of juvenile taste that took shape in these
early Byronic poems. He entitled them, with the lofty modesty of boyish
authorship, <i>Incondita</i>, and his parents sought to publish them. No
publisher could be found; but they won the attention of a notable
critic, W.J. Fox, who feared too much splendour and too little thought
in the young poet, but kept his eye on him nevertheless.</p>

<p>Two years later the boy of fourteen caught the accents of another
poetic voice, destined to touch the sources of music and passion in him
with far more intimate power. His casual discovery, on a bookstall, of
"Mr Shelley's Atheistical poem" seems to have for the first time made
known to him even the name of the poet who had died in Italy four years
before. Something <a name="page9" id="page9">of</a> Shelley's story
seems to have been known to his parents. It gives us a measure of the
indulgent sympathy and religious tolerance which prevailed in this
Evangelical home, that the parents should have unhesitatingly supplied
the boy of fourteen, at some cost of time and trouble, with all the
accessible writings of the "atheistical" poet, and with those of his
presumably like-minded friend Keats as well. He fell instantly under the
spell of both. Whatever he may have known before of ancient or modern
literature, the full splendour of romantic poetry here broke upon him
for the first time. Immature as he was, he already responded
instinctively to the call of the spirits most intimately akin to his
own. Byron's stormy power thrilled and delighted him; but it was too
poor in spiritual elements, too negative, self-centred, and destructive
to stir the deeper sources of Browning's poetry. In Keats and in Shelley
he found poetic energies not less glowing and intense, bent upon making
palpable to eye and ear visions of beauty which, with less of
superficial realism, were fed by far more exquisite and penetrating
senses, and attached by more and subtler filaments to the truth of
things. Beyond question this was the decisive literary experience of
Browning's early years. Probably it had a chief part in making the
poet's career his fixed ideal, and ultimately, with his father's willing
consent, his definite choice. What we know of his inner and outer life
during the important years which turned the boy into the man is slight
and baffling enough. The fiery spirit of poetry
<a name="page10" id="page10">can</a> rarely have worked out its way with
so little disturbance to the frame. Minute scrutiny has disclosed traits
of unrest and revolt; he professed "atheism" and practised
vegetarianism, betrayed at times the aggressive arrogance of an able
youth, and gave his devoted and tender parents moments of very
superfluous concern. For with all his immensely vivacious play of brain,
there was something in his mental and moral nature from first to last
stubbornly inelastic and unimpressible, that made him equally secure
against expansion and collapse. The same simple tenacity of nature which
kept his buoyantly adventurous intellect permanently within the tether
of a few primary convictions, kept him, in the region of practice and
morality, within the bounds of a rather nice and fastidious decorum.
Malign influences effected no lodgment in a nature so fundamentally
sound; they might cloud and trouble imagination for a while, but their
scope hardly extended further, and as they were literary in origin, so
they were mainly literary in expression. In the meantime he was laying,
in an unsystematic but not ineffective way, the foundations of his
many-sided culture and accomplishment. We hear much
of private tutors, of instruction in French, in music, in riding,
fencing, boxing, dancing; of casual attendance also at the Greek classes
in University College. In all these matters he seems to have won more or
less definite accomplishment, and from most of them his versatile
literary talent took, at one time or another, an effective
<a name="page11" id="page11">toll</a>. The athletic musician, who
composed his own songs and gloried in a gallop, was to make verse
simulate, as hardly any artificer had made it before, the labyrinthine
meanderings of the fugue and the rhythmic swing of hoofs.</p>

<p>Of all these varied aims and aspirations, of all in short that was
going on under the surface of this brilliant and versatile Robert
Browning of twenty, we have a chaotic reflection in the famous fragment
<i>Pauline</i>. The quite peculiar animosity with which its author in
later life regarded this single "crab" of his youthful tree of knowledge
only adds to its interest. He probably resented the frank expression of
passion, nowhere else approached in his works. Yet passion only agitates
the surface of <i>Pauline</i>. Whether Pauline herself stand for an
actual woman&mdash;Miss Flower or another&mdash;or for the nascent spell
of womanhood&mdash;she plays, for one who is ostensibly the heroine of
the poem, a discouragingly minor part. No wonder she felt tempted to
advise the burning of so unflattering a record. Instead of the lyric
language of love, she has to receive the confessions of a subtle
psychologist, who must unlock the tumultuous story of his soul "before
he can sing." And these confessions are of a kind rare even amongst
self-revelations of genius. Pauline's lover is a dreamer, but a dreamer
of an uncommon species. He is preoccupied with the processes of his
mind, but his mind ranges wildly over the universe and chafes at the
limitations it is forced to recognise. Mill, a master,
<a name="page12" id="page12">not</a> to say a pedant, of
introspection, recognised with amazement the "intense self-consciousness"
of this poet, and self-consciousness is the keynote which persists
through all its changing harmonies. It is the self-consciousness of a
soul compelled by quick and eager senses and vivid intelligence to
recognise a host of outer realities not itself, which it constantly
strives to bring into relation with itself, as constantly baffled and
thrown back by the obstinate objectivity of that outer world. A pure
dreamer would have "contentedly lived in a nut-shell and imagined
himself king of infinite space"; a purely scientific intelligence would
have applied himself to the patient mastery of facts; in the hero of
<i>Pauline</i> the despotic senses and intellect of science and the
imperious imagination of the poet appear to coexist and to contend, and
he tosses to and fro in a fever of fitful efforts, continually
frustrated, to find complete spiritual response and expressiveness in
the intractable maze of being. There had indeed been an earlier time
when the visions of old poets had wholly sufficed him; and the verses in
which he recalls them have almost the pellucid charm of Homer,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in3">"Never morn broke clear as those</span><br />
      On the dim clustered isles in the blue sea,<br />
      The deep groves, and white temples, and wet caves."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But growing intellect demanded something more.
Shelley, the "Sun-treader," weaving soul and sense into a radiant
vesture "from his poet's station between both," did much to sustain him;
Plato's more explicit <a name="page13" id="page13">and</a> systematic
idealism gave him for a while a stronger assurance. But disillusion
broke in: "Suddenly, without heart-wreck I awoke; I said, 'twas
beautiful, yet but a dream, and so adieu to it!" Then the passionate
restlessness of his nature stings him forth afresh. He steeps himself in
the concrete vitality of things, lives in imagination through "all life
where it is most alive," immerses himself in all that is most beautiful
and intense in Nature, so fulfilling, it might seem, his passionate
craving to "be all, have, see, know, taste, feel all,"&mdash;yet only to
feel that satisfaction is not here:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"My soul saddens when it looks beyond:<br />
      I cannot be immortal, taste all joy;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">only the sickness of satiety. But when all joy was
tasted, what then? If there was any "crowning" state, it could only be,
thought Browning, one in which the soul looked up to the unattainable
infinity of God.</p>

<p>Such seem to be the outlines of the mental history which passes before
us, brilliant and incoherent as a dream, in <i>Pauline</i>. The material,
vast and many-sided as it is, is not fully mastered; but there is
nothing merely imitative; it is everywhere Browning, and no mere
disciple of Shelley or another, who is palpably at work. The influence
of Shelley seems, indeed, to have been already outgrown when
<i>Pauline</i> was written; Browning gloried in him and in his
increasing fame, but he felt that his own aims and destiny were
different. Rossetti, a few years later, took <i>Pauline</i> to be the
work of an <a name="page14" id="page14">unconscious</a> pre-Raphaelite;
and there is enough of subtle simplicity, of curious minuteness, in the
details to justify the error. In the meantime many outward circumstances
conspired to promote the "advance" which every line of it foretold. His
old mentor of the <i>Incondita</i> days, W.J. Fox, in some sort a
Browningite before Browning, reviewed <i>Pauline</i> in <i>The Monthly
Repository</i> (April 1833) with generous but discerning praise. This
was the beginning of a warm friendship between the two, which ended only
with Fox's death. It was founded upon hearty admiration on both sides,
and no man living was better qualified to scatter the morbid films that
clung about the expanding genius of young Browning than this robust and
masculine critic and preacher. A few months later came an event of which
we know very little, but which at least did much to detach him from the
limited horizons of Camberwell. At the invitation of M. Benckhausen,
Russian consul-general, Browning accompanied him, in the winter of
1833-34, on a special mission to St Petersburg. The journey left few
apparent traces on his work. But he remembered the rush of the sledge
through the forest when, half a century later, he told the thrilling
tale of <i>Iv&aacute;n Ivánovitch</i>. And even the modest intimacy with
affairs of State obtainable in the office of a consul-general seems to
have led his thoughts seriously to diplomacy as a career. One
understands that to the future dissector of a Hohenstiel-Schwangau and a
Blougram the career might present attractions. It
<a name="page15" id="page15">marks</a> the seriousness of his ambition
that he actually applied for a post in the Persian Embassy. This fancy
of <i>Ferishtah</i>, like a similar one of ten years later, was not
gratified, but the bent which was thus thwarted in practical life
disported itself freely in poetry, and the marks of the diplomatist <i>in
posse</i> are pretty clearly legible in the subtle political webs which
make up so much of the plots of <i>Strafford</i>, <i>King Victor</i>, and
<i>Sordello</i>.</p>

<p>But much sharper rebuffs than this would have failed to disturb the
immense buoyancy of Browning's temperament. He was twenty-three, and in
the first flush of conscious power. His exuberant animal spirits flowed
out in whimsical talk; he wrote letters of the gayest undergraduate
<i>insouciance</i> to Fox, and articles full of extravagant jesting for
<i>The Trifler</i>, an amateur journal which received the lucubrations
of his little circle. He enjoyed life like a boy, and shared its
diversions like a man about town. These superficial vivacities were the
slighter play of a self-consciousness which in its deeper recesses was
steadily gathering power, richness, and assurance. His keen social
instincts saved him from most of the infirmities of budding genius; but
the poems he contributed to Fox's journal during the following two years
(1834-36) show a significant predilection for imagining the
extravagances and fanaticisms of lonely self-centred minds. Joannes
Agricola, sublime on the dizzy pinnacle of his theological arrogance,
looking up through the gorgeous <a name="page16" id="page16">roof</a> of
heaven and assured that nothing can stay his course to his destined
abode, God's breast; Porphyria's lover, the more uncanny fanatic who
murders with a smile; the young man who in his pride of power sees in
the failures and mistakes of other men examples providentially intended
for his guidance,&mdash;it was such subjects as these that touched
Browning's fancy in those ardent and sanguine years. He probably entered
with keener relish into these extravagances than his maturer wisdom
approved. It is significant, at any rate, that when <i>Agricola</i> and
<i>Porphyria's Lover</i> were republished in <i>The Bells and
Pomegranates</i> of 1842, a new title, <i>Madhouse Cells</i>, gave
warning that their insanity was not to be attributed to the poet. The
verses "Still ailing wind," he qualified in a yet more explicit fashion
twenty years later, for they are the young man's poem which James Lee's
wife reads "under the cliff," and subjects to her austere and
disillusioned criticism. But they mark the drift of Browning of the
mid-'Thirties, so far as they go, clearly enough. Fortunately, however,
we are not dependent upon these slight clues. For during the winter
months of 1834-35 he was occupied in portraying a far more imposing
embodiment of the young man's pride of power, a Joannes Agricola of
equally superb confidence and far more magnificent ideals. In April 1835
Browning was able to announce to his good friend Fox the completion of
<i>Paracelsus</i>.</p>

<p>He owed the suggestion to another new acquaintance, whose intimacy,
like that of the Russian consul-general, <a name="page17"
id="page17">marks</a> the fascination exercised by young Browning upon
men of antecedents, race, and social standing widely different from his
own. Count Amédée de Ripert Monclar was a French royalist and refugee;
he was also an enthusiastic student of history. Possibly he recognised
an affinity between the vaguely outlined dreams of Pauline's lover and
those of the historic Paracelsus; and he may well have thought that the
task of grappling with definite historic material would steady the young
poet's hand. We could applaud the acuteness of the suggestion with more
confidence had not the Count had an unlucky afterthought, which he
regarded as fatal, to the effect that the story of Paracelsus, however
otherwise adapted to the creator of Pauline's lover, was entirely
destitute of a Pauline. There was no opening for love. But Pauline, with
all her warm erotic charms and her sparkling French prose, was the most
unsubstantial and perishable thing in the poem which bore her name: she
and the spirit which begot her had vanished like a noisome smoke, and
Browning threw himself with undiminished ardour upon the task of
interpreting a career in which the sole sources of romance and of
tragedy appeared to be the passion for knowledge and the arrogance of
discovery.</p>

<p>For it is quite clear that, whatever criticisms Browning finally
brought to bear upon Paracelsus, his attitude towards him, at no time
hostile, was at the outset rather that of a literary champion,
vindicating a man of original <a name="page18" id="page18">genius</a>
from the calumnies of ignorance and dulness. This
view, then rather unusual, was a very natural one for him to take,
Paracelsus being among the many keen interests of the elder
Browning.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref5" id="fnref5"
href="#fn5">[5]</a></span> It is a strange mistake to suppose, with a
recent very ingenious commentator, that Browning, eager to destroy the
fallacy of intellectual pride, singled out Paracelsus as a crucial
example of the futilities of intellect. On the contrary, he filled his
annotations with documentary evidences which attest not only the
commanding scientific genius of Paracelsus, but the real significance of
his achievements, even for the modern world. In the intellectual hunger
of Paracelsus, in that "insatiable avidity of penetrating the secrets of
nature" which his follower Bitiskius (approvingly quoted by Browning)
ascribed to him, he saw a fascinating realisation of his own vague and
chaotic "restlessness." Here was a spirit made up in truth "of an
intensest life," driven hither and thither by the hunger for
intellectual mastery of the universe; and Browning, far from convicting
him of intellectual futility, has made him actually divine the secret he
sought, and, in one of the most splendid passages of modern poetry,
declare with his dying lips a faith which is no less Browning's than his
own.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn5" id="fn5" href="#fnref5">[5]</a></span>
His library, as I am informed by Prof. Hall Griffin, contained a copy of
the works of Paracelsus, doubtless that used by his son.
</div>

<p>While he thus lavished his utmost power on portraying the soaring
genius of Paracelsus, as he conceived it, he turned impatiently away
from the husk of popular legend <a name="page19" id="page19">by</a>
which it was half obscured. He shrank from no attested fact, however
damaging; but he brushed away the accretions of folklore, however
picturesque. The attendant spirit who enabled Paracelsus to work his
marvellous cures, and his no less renowned Sword, were for Browning
contemptible futilities. Yet a different way of treating legend lay
nearer to the spirit of contemporary poetry. Goethe had not long before
evolved his Mephistopheles from the "attendant spirit" attached by that
same sixteenth century to the Paracelsus of Protestantism, Faust;
Tennyson was already meditating a scene full of the enchantment of the
Arthurian sword Excalibur. Browning's peremptory rejection of such
springs of poetry marks one of his limitations as a poet. Much of the
finest poetry of <i>Faust</i>, as, in a lower degree, of
the <i>Idylls</i>, is won by a subtle transformation of the rude stuff of
popular imagination: for Browning, with rare exceptions, this rude stuff
was dead matter, impervious to his poetic insight, and irresponsive to
the magic of his touch. Winnowing the full ears, catching eagerly the
solid and stimulating grain, he hardly heeded the golden gleam of the
chaff as it flew by.</p>

<p>He did not, however, refrain from accentuating his view of the story
by interweaving in it some gracious figures of his own. Festus, the
honest, devoted, but somewhat purblind friend, who offers Paracelsus the
criticism of sober common-sense, and is vindicated&mdash;at the bar of
common-sense&mdash;by his great comrade's tragic
<a name="page20" id="page20">end</a>; Michal, an exquisitely
tender outline of womanhood, even more devoted, and even less
distinguished; and the "Italian poet" Aprile, a creature of genius,
whose single overpowering thought avails to break down the stronghold of
Paracelsus's else unassailable conviction. Aprile, who lives for love as
Paracelsus for knowledge, is not to be identified with Shelley, but he
has unmistakable Shelleyan traits, and the dreamy pageant of his
imaginary creations might stand for a summary review of Shelley's work.
Had Shelley lived, he might have come nearer than any one else to
fulfilling the rounded and complete ideal of which Paracelsus and Aprile
were dissevered halves: the greater part of his actual achievement
belonged, Browning evidently thought, to the category of those dazzling
but imperfectly objective visions which he ascribes to his Aprile. But
Shelley&mdash;the poet of <i>Alastor</i>, the passionate "lover of
Love," was yet the fittest embodiment of that other finer spiritual
energy which Paracelsus in his Faustian passion for knowledge had
ruthlessly put from him. Sixteen years later, Browning was to define in
memorable words what he held to be the "noblest and predominating
characteristic of Shelley"&mdash;viz., "his simultaneous perception of
Power and Love in the Absolute and of Beauty and Good in the concrete,
while he throws, from his poet's station between both, swifter, subtler,
and more numerous films for the connection of each with each than have
been thrown by any modern artificer of
<a name="page21" id="page21">whom</a> I have knowledge." This divining
and glorifying power it is that Browning ascribes to Love; the lack of
it is in his conception the tragic flaw which brings to the ground the
superbly gifted genius of Paracelsus. This genuine and original tragic
motive is not worked out with uniform power; his degeneration, his
failures, are painted with the uncertain hand of one little acquainted
with either. But all the splendour of a young imagination, charged with
the passion for truth and for beauty, glows in the pictures of the great
moments in Paracelsus's career,&mdash;the scene in the quiet
W&uuml;rzburg garden, where he conquers the doubts of Festus and Michal
by the magnificent assurance of his faith in his divine calling; and
that in the hospital cell at Salzburg, where his fading mind anticipates
at the point of death the clearness of immortal vision as he lays bare
the conquered secret of the world.</p>

<p>That Paracelsian secret of the world was for Browning doubtless the
truth, though he never again expounded it so boldly. Paracelsus's reply
to the anxious inquiry of Festus whether he is sure of God's
forgiveness: "I have lived! We have to live alone to well set forth
God's praise"&mdash;might stand as a text before the works of Browning.
In all life he sees the promise and the potency of God,&mdash;in the
teeming vitalities of the lower world, in the creative energies of man,
in the rich conquests of his Art, in his myth-woven Nature. "God is
glorified in Man, and to man's glory vowed I soul and limb."
<a name="page22" id="page22">The</a> historic Paracelsus failed most
signally in his attempt to connect vast conceptions of Nature akin to
this with the detail of his empiric discoveries. Browning, with his
mind, as always, set upon things psychical, attributes to him a parallel
incapacity to connect his far-reaching vision of humanity with the
gross, malicious, or blockish specimens of the genus Man whom he
encountered in the detail of practice. It was the problem which Browning
himself was to face, and in his own view triumphantly to solve; and
Paracelsus, rising into the clearness of his dying vision, becomes the
mouthpiece of Browning's own criticism of his failure, the impassioned
advocate of the Love which with him is less an elemental energy drawing
things into harmonious fusion than a subtle weapon of the intellect,
making it wise</p>

<p class="noindent">Paracelsus is a clear self-revelation, rich and

if at all to the early manhood of genius,&mdash;a beauty like that of

overworn, and the problems of full maturity, though foreshadowed and
foreseen, have not yet begun to perplex or to disintegrate.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Paracelsus</i>, though only a series of
quasi-dramatic scenes, suggested considerable undeveloped capacity for
drama. From a career in which the most sensational event was a dismissal
from a professorship, and the absorbing passion the thirst for
knowledge, he had elicited a tragedy of the scientific intellect. But it
was equally obvious that the writer's talent was not purely dramatic;
and that his most splendid and original endowments required some other
medium than drama for their full unfolding. The author of
<i>Paracelsus</i> was primarily concerned with character, and with
action as the mirror of character; agreeing in both points substantially
with the author of <i>Hamlet</i>. But while Browning's <a name="page25"
id="page25">energetic</a> temperament habitually impelled him to
represent character in action, his imaginative strength did not lie in
the region of action at all, but in the region of thought; the kinds of
expression of which he had boundless command were rather those which
analyse character than those which exhibit it. The two impulses derived
from temperament and from imagination thus drew him in somewhat diverse
directions; and for some years the joy in the stir and stress and
many-sided life of drama competed with the powerful bent of the
portrayer of souls, until the two contending currents finally coalesced
in the dramatic monologues of <i>Men and Women</i>. In 1835 the solution
was not yet found, but the five years which followed were to carry
Browning, not without crises of perplexity and hesitation, far on his
way towards it. <i>Paracelsus</i> was no sooner completed than he
entered upon his kindred but more esoteric portrayal of the soul-history
of Sordello,&mdash;a study in which, with the dramatic form, almost all
the dramatic excellences of its predecessors are put aside. But the poet
was outgrowing the method; the work hung fire; and we find him, before
he had gone far with the perplexed record of that "ineffectual angel,"
already "eager to freshen a jaded mind by diverting it to the healthy
natures of a grand epoch."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref6"

Preface to the first edition of <i>Strafford</i> (subsequently omitted).
</div>

<p>The open-eyed man of the world and of affairs in Browning was plainly
clamouring for more expression than he had yet found. An invitation from
the first <a name="page26" id="page26">actor</a> of the day to write a
tragedy for him was not likely, under these circumstances, to be
declined; and during the whole winter of 1836-37 the story of Sordello
remained untold, while its author plunged, with a security and relish
which no one who knew only his poetry could have foretold, into the
pragmatic politics and diplomatic intrigues of <i>Strafford</i>. The
performance of the play on May 1, 1837 introduced further distractions.
And <i>Sordello</i> had made little further progress, when, in the April
of the following year, Browning embarked on a sudden but memorable trip
to the South of Europe. It gave him his first glimpse of Italy and of
the Mediterranean, and plenty of the rough homely intercourse with men
which he loved. He travelled, in a fashion that suited his purse and his
hardy nature, by a merchant vessel from London to the Adriatic. The food
was uneatable, the horrors of dirt and discomfort portentous; but he
bore them cheerfully for the sake of one advantage,&mdash;"the
solitariness of the <i>one</i> passenger among all those rough new
creatures, <i>I</i> like it much, and soon get deep into their
friendship."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref7" id="fnref7"

within his ken.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref8" id="fnref8"

for us with peculiar distinctness: the gorgeous sunset off Cadiz bay,
when he watched the fading outlines of Gibraltar and Cape St
Vincent,&mdash;ghostly mementos of England,&mdash;not as Arnold's weary
Titan, but as a Herakles stretching a hand of help
<a name="page27" id="page27">across</a> the seas; the other sunset on the
Mediterranean, when Etna loomed against the flaming
sky;<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref9" id="fnref9"
href="#fn9">[9]</a></span> and, between them, that glaring noontide on
the African shore, when the "solitary passenger," weary of shipboard and
sea sickness, longed for his good horse York in the stable at home, and
scribbled his ballad of brave horses, <i>How they brought the Good
News</i>, in a blank leaf of Bartoli's <i>Simboli</i>. The voyage ended
at Trieste; and thence he passed to Venice, brooded among her ruined
palaces over Sordello, and "English Eyebright" and all the destiny and
task of the poet; and so turned homeward, through the mountains,
gathering vivid glimpses as he went of "all my places and castles,"<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref10" id="fnref10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></span>
and laying by a memory, soon to germinate, of "delicious Asolo,"
"palpably fire-clothed" in the glory of his young imagination.</p>

<p>Thus when, in 1840, <i>Sordello</i> was at length complete, it bore
the traces of many influences and many moods. It reflected the expanding
ideals and the critical turning-points of four years of his life. In the
earlier books the brilliant yet self-centred poet of <i>Paracelsus</i> is
still paramount, and even the "oddish boy" who had shyly evolved
<i>Pauline</i> is not entirely effaced. But in the later books we
recognise without difficulty the man who has mixed with the larger
world, has won some fame in letters, has immersed himself in the
stirring atmosphere of a supreme national conflict, has seen Italy, and
has, in the solitude and detachment from his <i>milieu</i> which foreign
travel brings, girded up his loins anew for a
<a name="page28" id="page28">larger</a> and more exacting poetic task.
The tangled political dissensions of the time are set before us with the
baffling allusiveness of the expert. The Italian landscape is painted,
not with richer imagination, for nothing in Browning exceeds some
passages of the earlier books, but with more depth of colouring, more
precision of contour and expression. And he has taken the "sad
disheveled form," Humanity, for his bride, the mate of an art which will
disdain no evil and turn away from nothing common, in the service of
man. Doubtless the result was not all gain. The intermittent composition
and the shifting points of view add an element of real ambiguity and
indecision to faults of expression which mainly spring from the
swiftness and discursiveness of a brilliant and athletic intellect. The
alleged "obscurity" of the poem is in great part a real obscurity; the
profiles are at times not merely intricate, but blurred. But he had
written nothing yet, and he was to write little after, which surpasses
the finest pages of <i>Sordello</i> in close-packed, if somewhat
elusive, splendour; the soil, as he wrote of Italy, is full of loose
fertility, and gives out intoxicating odours at every footfall.
Moreover, he can now paint the clash and commotion of crowds, the
turmoil of cities and armies, with superb force&mdash;a capacity of
which there is hardly a trace in <i>Paracelsus</i>. Sordello himself
stands out less clearly than Paracelsus from the canvas; but the
sympathetic reader finally admits that this visionary being, who gleams
ghostlike at the end of all the avenues <a name="page29"
id="page29">and</a> vistas of the poem, whom we are always looking at
but never rightly see, is an even more fascinating figure.</p>

<p>He is however less historical, in spite of the abstruse historic
background upon which he moves. Of the story of Paracelsus Browning
merely reinterpreted the recorded facts; whereas he brushes aside the
greater part of the Sordello story, as told confusedly and
inconsistently by Italian and Provençal tradition. The whole later
career of the Mantuan poet as an accomplished and not unsuccessful man
of the world, as the friend of Raymond of Toulouse and Charles of Anjou,
rewarded with ample estates by the latter for substantial
services,&mdash;is either rejected as myth, or purposely ignored. To all
appearance, the actual Sordello by no means lacked ability to "fit to
the finite" such "infinity" as he possessed. And if he had the chance,
as is obscurely hinted at the close, of becoming, like Dante, the
"Apollo" of the Italian people, he hardly missed it "through disbelief
that anything was to be done." But the outward shell of his career
included some circumstances which, had they befallen a Dante, might have
deeply moulded the history of Italy. His close relations with great
Guelph and Ghibelline families would have offered extraordinary
opportunities to a patriot of genius, which, for the purposes of
patriotism, remained unused. Yet Dante, a patriot of genius if ever
there was one, had given Sordello a position of extraordinary honour in
the <i>Purgatory</i>, had allowed him to illuminate <a name="page30"
id="page30">the</a> darkness of Virgil, and to guide both the great
poets towards the Gate. The contrast offered an undeniable problem. But
Dante had himself hinted the solution by placing Sordello among those
dilatory souls whose tardy repentance involved their sojourn in the
Ante-purgatory. To a mind preoccupied, like Browning's, with the
failures of aspiring souls, this hint naturally appealed. He imagined
his Sordello, too, as a moral loiterer, who, with extraordinary gifts,
failed by some inner enervating paralysis<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref11" id="fnref11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></span>
to make his spiritual quality explicit; and who impressed contemporaries
sufficiently to start a brilliant myth of what he did not do, but had to
wait for recognition until he met the eye and lips of Dante. It is
difficult not to suspect the influence of another great poet.
<i>Sordello</i> has no nearer parallel in literature than Goethe's
<i>Tasso</i>, a picture of the eternal antagonism between the poet and
the world, for which Bordello's failure to "fit to the finite his
infinity" might have served as an apt motto. Browning has nowhere to our
knowledge mentioned <i>Tasso</i>; but he has left on record his
admiration of the beautiful sister-drama
<i>Iphigenie</i>.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref12" id="fnref12"

declaration that "nothing so Hellenic had been written these two

</div>

<p>The elaboration of this conception is, however,
<a name="page31" id="page31">entirely</a> Browning's own, and discloses
at every point the individual quality of his mind. Like <i>Faust</i>,
like the Poet in the <i>Palace of Art</i>, Sordello bears the
stamp of an age in which the ideal of intellect, art, culture, and the
ideal of humanity, of social service, have both become potent
inspirations, often in apparent conflict, and continually demanding a
solution of their differences. Faust breaks away from the narrow
pedantries of the schools in order to heap upon his breast the weal and
woe of mankind, and to draw all their life and thought into the compass
of his mind. Tennyson's "glorious devil" (by a curious irony intended
for no other than Faust's creator) sets up his lordly pleasure-house
apart from the ways of men, until at last, confuted by experience, he
renounces his folly. <i>Sordello</i> cannot claim the mature and
classical brilliance of the one, nor the limpid melodious beauty of the
other; but it approaches <i>Faust</i> itself in its subtle soundings of
the mysteries of the intellectual life. It is a young poet's attempt to
cope with the problem of the poet's task and the poet's function, the
relation of art to life, and of life to art. Neither Goethe nor Tennyson
thought more loftily of the possibilities of poetic art. And neither
insisted more peremptorily&mdash;or rather assumed more
unquestioningly&mdash;that it only fulfils these possibilities when the
poet labours in the service of man. He is "earth's essential king," but
his kingship rests upon his carrying out the kingliest of
mottoes&mdash;"Ich dien." Browning <a name="page32" id="page32">all</a>
his life had a hearty contempt for the foppery of "Art for Art," and he
never conveyed it with more incisive brilliance than in the sketch of
Bordello's "opposite," the Troubadour Eglamor.</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in4">"How he loved that art!</span><br />
      The calling marking him a man apart<br />

      Was his, and men, the whole of them, must shift<br />
      Without it."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To Eglamor his art is a mysterious ritual, of which
he is the sacrosanct priest, and his happy rhyme the divine response
vouchsafed to him in answer. Such beauty as he produces is no effluence
from a soul mating itself, like Wordsworth's, "in love and holy passion
with the universe," but a cunning application of the approved recipes
for effective writing current in the literary guild;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in5">"He, no genius rare,</span><br />

</div>

<p>From these mysticisms and technicalities of Troubadour and all other
poetic guilds Browning decisively detaches his poet. Sordello is not a
votary of poetry; he does not "cultivate the Muse"; he does not even
<a name="page33" id="page33">prostrate</a> himself before the beauty and
wonder of the visible universe. Poetry is the atmosphere in which he
lives; and in the beauty without he recognises the "dream come true" of
a soul which (like that of Pauline's lover) "existence" thus "cannot
satiate, cannot surprise." "Laugh thou at envious fate," adorers cry to
this inspired Platonist,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Who, from earth's simplest combination ...<br />

<p class="noindent">And, in truth, his power of imaginative apprehension
has no bounds. From the na&iuml;ve self-reflection of his boyish dreams
he passes on to visions which embrace a continually fuller measure of
life, until he forestalls the sublime Dantesque conception of a poetry
vast and deep as humanity, where every soul will stand forth revealed in
its naked truth. But he cannot, like Dante, put his vast conceptions into
the shackles of intelligible speech. His uncompromising "infinity" will
not comply with finite conditions, and he remains an inefficient and
inarticulate genius, a Hamlet of poetry.</p>

<p>In the second half of the poem the Hamlet of poetry becomes likewise a
Hamlet of politics. He aspires to serve the people otherwise than by
holding up to them the mirror of an all-revealing poetry. Though by
birth associated with the aristocratic and imperial Ghibellines, his
natural affinity is clearly with the Church, which in
<a name="page34" id="page34">some</a> sort stood for the people against
the nobles, and for spirit against brute force. We see him, now, a
frail, inspired Shelleyan<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref15"
id="fnref15" href="#fn15">[15]</a></span> democrat, pleading the Guelph
cause before the great Ghibelline soldier Salinguerra,&mdash;as he had
once pitted the young might of native song against the accomplished
Troubadour Eglamor. Salinguerra is the foil of the political, as Eglamor
of the literary, Sordello, and the dramatic interest of the whole poem
focusses in those two scenes. He had enough of the lonely inspiration of
genius to vanquish the craftsman, but too little of its large humanity
to cope with the astute man of the world. When Salinguerra, naturally
declining his naïve entreaty that he should put his Ghibelline sword at
the service of the Guelph, offers Sordello, on his part, the command of
the imperial forces in Italy if he will remain true to the Ghibelline
cause, he makes this finite world more alluring than it had ever been
before to the "infinite" Sordello. After a long struggle, he renounces
the offer, and&mdash;dies, exhausted with the strain of choice.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn15" id="fn15" href="#fnref15">[15]</a></span>
There are other Shelleyan traits in <i>Sordello</i>&mdash;e.g., the
young witch image (as in <i>Pauline</i>) at the opening of the second
book.
</div>

<p>What was Browning's judgment upon Sordello? Does he regard him as an
idealist of aims too lofty for success in this world, and whose
"failure" implied his triumph in another, where his "broken arc" would
become the "perfect round"? Assuredly not. That might indeed be his
destiny, but Browning makes it perfectly clear
<a name="page35" id="page35">that</a> he failed, not
because his ideal was incommensurate with the conditions in which he
lived, but because he lacked the supreme gift by which the greatest of
souls may find their function and create their sphere in the least
promising <i>milieu</i>,&mdash;a controlling and guiding passion of
love. With compassionate tenderness, as of a father to his wayward
child, Browning in the closing pages of the poem lays his finger on the
ailing place. "Ah, my Sordello, I this once befriend and speak for you."
It was true enough, in the past, that Soul, as belonging to Eternity,
must needs prove incomplete for Time. But is life to be therefore only a
struggle to escape from the shackles of the body? Is freedom only won by
death? No, rejoins the poet, and the reply comes from the heart of his
poetry, though at issue with much of his explicit doctrine; a harmony of
soul and body is possible here in which both fulfil their functions:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Like yonder breadth of watery heaven, a bay,<br />
      And that sky-space of water, ray for ray<br />
      And star for star, one richness where they mixed,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the Soul seeing its way in Time without being either
dazzled by, or losing, its vision of Eternity, having the saving clue of
Love. Dante, for whom Love was the pervading spirit of the universe, and
the beginning and end of his inspiration, wrought his vision of eternal
truth and his experience of the passing lives of men into such a harmony
with unexampled power; and <a name="page36" id="page36">the</a>
comparison, implicit in every page of <i>Sordello</i>, is driven home
with almost scornful bitterness on the last:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in5">"What he should have been,</span><br />
      Could be, and was not&mdash;the one step too mean<br />

      Such life is, after all!"</p>
</div>

<p>The publication of <i>Sordello</i> in 1840 closes the first phase of
Browning's literary career. By the great majority of those who had
hailed the splendid promise of <i>Paracelsus</i>, the author of
<i>Sordello</i> was frankly given up. Surprisingly few thought it worth
while to wrestle with the difficult book. It was the day of the gentle
literary public which had a few years before recoiled from <i>Sartor
Resartus</i>, and which found in the difficulty of a book the strongest
presumption against it. A later generation, leavened by Carlyle, came
near to regarding difficulty as a presumption in its favour, and this
more strenuous and athletic attitude towards literature was among the
favouring conditions which brought Browning at length into vogue.</p>

<p class="noindent">The memorable moment when Browning, standing on the
ruined palace-step at Venice, had taken Humanity for his mate, opened an
epoch in his poetic life to which the later books of <i>Sordello</i>
form a splendid prelude. For the Browning of 1840 it was no longer a
sufficient task to trace the epochs in the spiritual history of lonely
idealists, to pursue the problem of existence in minds themselves
preoccupied with its solution. "Soul" is still his fundamental
preoccupation; but the continued play of an eager intellect and
vivacious senses upon life has immensely multiplied the points of
concrete experience which it vivifies and transfigures to his eyes. It
is as if a painter trained in the school of Raphael or Lionardo had
discovered <a name="page38" id="page38">that</a> he could use the
minute and fearless brush of the Flemings in the service of their
ideals. He pursues soul in all its rich multiplicity, in the
tortuosities and dark abysses of character; he forces crowds of sordid,
grotesque, or commonplace facts to become its expressive speech; he
watches its thought and passion projected into the tide of affairs,
caught up in the clash and tangle of plot. In all these three ways the
Dramas and Dramatic Lyrics and Romances, which were to be his poetic
occupation during the Forties, detach themselves sharply from
<i>Paracelsus</i> and the early books of <i>Sordello</i>. A poem like
<i>The Laboratory</i> (1844), for instance, stands at almost the
opposite pole of art to these. All that Browning neglected or veiled in
<i>Paracelsus</i> he here thrusts into stern relief. The passion and
crime there faintly discerned in the background of ideally beautiful
figures are here his absorbing theme. The curious technicalities of the
chemist's workshop, taken for granted in <i>Paracelsus</i>, are now
painted with a realism reminiscent of Romeo's Apothecary and <i>The
Alchemist</i>. And the outward drama of intrigue, completely effaced in
<i>Paracelsus</i> by the inward drama of soul, sounds delusive scorn and
laughter in the background, the more sinister because it is not seen.
These lyrics and romances are "dramatic" not only in the sense that the
speakers express, as Browning insisted, other minds and sentiments than
his own, but in the more legitimate sense that they are plucked as it
were out <a name="page39" id="page39">of</a> the living organism of a
drama, all the vital issues of which can be read in their
self-revelation.</p>

<p>A poet whose lyrics were of this type might be expected to find in
drama proper his free, full, and natural expression. This was not
altogether the case with Browning, who, despite an unquenchable
appetency for drama, did better work in his dramatic monologues than in
his plays. The drama alone allowed full scope for the development of
plot-interest. But it was less favourable to another yet more deeply
rooted interest of his. Not only did action and outward event&mdash;the
stuff of drama&mdash;interest Browning chiefly as "incidents in the
development of soul," but they became congenial to his art only as
projected upon some other mind, and tinged with its feeling and its
thought. Half the value of a story for him lay in the colours it derived
from the narrator's personality; and he told his own experience, as he
uttered his own convictions, most easily and effectively through alien
lips. For a like reason he loved to survey the slow continuities of
actual events from the standpoint of a given moment, under the
conditions of perspective and illusion which it imposed. Both these
conditions were less well satisfied by drama, which directly "imitates
action," than by the dramatic speech or monologue, which imitates action
as focussed in a particular mind. And Browning's dramatic genius found
its most natural and effective outlet in the wealth of implicit drama
which he concentrated in <a name="page40" id="page40">these</a> salient
moments tense with memory and hope. The insuppressible alertness and
enterprise of his own mind tells upon his portrayal of these intense
moments. He sees passion not as a blinding fume, but as a flame, which
enlarges the area, and quickens the acuteness, of vision; the background
grows alive with moving shapes. To the stricken girl in <i>Ye Banks and
Braes</i> memory is torture, and she thrusts convulsively from her, like
dagger-points, the intolerable loveliness of the things that remind her
of her love; whereas the victim of <i>The Confessional</i> pours forth
from her frenzied lips every detail of her tragic story.</p>

<p>So in <i>The Laboratory</i>, once more, all the strands of the
implicit drama are seen like incandescent filaments in the glow of a
single moment of fierce impassioned consciousness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"He is with her, and they know that I know<br />
      Where they are, what they do: they believe my tears flow<br />
      While they laugh, laugh at me, at me fled to the drear<br />
      Empty church, to pray God in, for them!&mdash;I am here."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Both kinds&mdash;drama and dramatic
lyric&mdash;continued to attract him, while neither altogether
satisfied; and they engaged him concurrently throughout the decade.</p>

<p>In this power of seizing the salient moment of a complex situation and
laying bare at a stroke all its issues, Browning's monologues have no
nearer parallel than the Imaginary Conversations of Landor, which
illuminate with so strange a splendour so many unrecorded scenes of the
great drama of history. To <a name="page41" id="page41">Landor</a>,
according to his wife's testimony, Browning "always said that he owed
more than to any contemporary"; to Landor he dedicated the last volume
of the <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>. Landor, on his part, hailed in
Browning the "inquiring eye" and varied discourse of a second Chaucer.
It is hardly rash to connect with his admiration for the elder artist
Browning's predilection for these brief revealing glimpses into the
past. Browning cared less for the actual <i>personnel</i> of history,
and often imagined his speakers as well as their talk; but he imagined
them with an equal instinct for seizing the expressive traits of
nationalities and of times, and a similar, if more spontaneous and
naïve, anti-feudal temper. The French camp and the Spanish cloister,
<i>Gismond</i> and <i>My Last Duchess</i> (originally called
<i>France</i> and <i>Italy</i>), are penetrated with the spirit of
peoples, ages, and institutions as seized by a historical student of
brilliant imagination and pronounced antipathies.</p>

<p>But in one point Landor and Browning stood at opposite poles. Landor,
far beyond any contemporary English example, had the classic sense and
mastery of style; Browning's individuality of manner rested on a robust
indifference to all the traditional conventions of poetic speech. The
wave of realism which swept over English letters in the early 'Forties
broke down many barriers of language; the new things that had to be said
demanded new ways of saying them; homely, grotesque, or sordid life was
rendered in sordid, <a name="page42" id="page42">grotesque</a>, and
homely terms. <i>Pickwick</i> in 1837 had established the immense vogue
of Dickens, the <i>Heroes</i> in 1840 had assured the imposing prestige
of Carlyle; and the example of both made for the freest and boldest use
of language. Across the Channel the stupendous fabric of the <i>Comédie
Humaine</i> was approaching completion, and Browning was one of Balzac's
keenest English readers. Alone among the greater poets of the time
Browning was in genius and temperament a true kinsman to these great
romantic realists; his poetry, as it emerged in the rich dramatic
harvest of the 'Forties, is the nearest counterpart and analogue of
their prose.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Browning's first drama, as is well known, was the result of a direct
application from Macready. Introduced in November 1835 by his "literary
father" Fox, Browning immediately interested the actor. A reading of
<i>Paracelsus</i> convinced him that Browning could write, if not a good
play, yet one with an effective tragic <i>rôle</i> for himself. Strained
relations with his company presently made him eager to procure this
service. Browning, suddenly appealed to (in May 1836), promptly
suggested <i>Strafford</i>. He was full of the subject, having recently
assisted his friend Forster in compiling his life. The actor closed with
the suggestion, and a year later (May 1, 1837) the play was
<a name="page43" id="page43">performed</a> at Covent Garden. The fine
acting of Macready, and of Helen Faucit, who was now associated with
him, procured the piece a moderate success. It went through five
performances.</p>

<p>Browning's <i>Strafford</i>, like his <i>Paracelsus</i>, was a
serious attempt to interpret a historic character; and historic experts
like Gardiner have, as regards the central figure, emphatically indorsed
his judgment. The other persons, and the action itself, he treated more
freely, with evident regard to their value as secondary elements in the
portrayal of Stafford; and it is easy to trace in the whole manner of
his innovations the well-marked ply of his mind. The harsh and rugged
fanaticisms, the splendid frivolities, of the seventeenth century, fade
and lose substance in an atmosphere charged with idealism and
self-consciousness. Generous self-devotion is not the universal note,
but it is the prevailing key, that in which the writer most naturally
thinks and most readily invents. Strafford's devotion to Charles and
Pym's to his country were historical; but Browning accentuates Pym's
heroism by making the man he sends to the scaffold his old friend; and
devotion is the single trait of the beautiful but imaginary character of
Lucy Carlisle. "Give me your notion of a thorough self-devotement,
self-forgetting," he wrote a few years later to Miss Flower: the idea
seems to have been already busy moulding his still embryonic invention
of character. Something of the visionary exaltation of the dying
Paracelsus thus hangs <a name="page44" id="page44">over</a> the final
scene in which Strafford goes to meet the fate which the one friend
imposes on him and the other cannot turn aside. All the characters have
something of the "deep self-consciousness" of the author of
<i>Pauline</i>. Not that they are, any of them, drawn with very profound
grasp of human nature or a many-sided apprehension of life. They are
either absolutely simple, like Lady Carlisle, or built upon a rivalry or
conflict of simple elements, like Strafford and Charles; but there is so
much restless vivacity in their discourse, the broad surface of mood is
so incessantly agitated by the play and cross-play of thought and
feeling, that they seem more complex than they are.</p>

<p>Though played for only five nights, <i>Strafford</i> had won a
success which might well have dazzled a young and untried aspirant, and
which was sufficiently impressive to shrewd men of business like Messrs
Longman to induce them to undertake its publication free of cost. It
appeared in April, with an interesting preface, subsequently withdrawn,
from which a significant sentence has already been quoted. The
composition of <i>Strafford</i> had not only "freshened a jaded mind"
but permanently quickened his zest for the drama of political crises.
New projects for historical dramas chased and jostled one another
through his busy brain, which seems to have always worked most
prosperously in a highly charged atmosphere. I am going "to begin
... thinking a Tragedy," he wrote characteristically to Miss
Haworth&mdash;"(an Historical one, so I shall want heaps of
<a name="page45" id="page45">criticisms</a> on <i>Strafford</i>), and I
want to have <i>another</i> tragedy in prospect; I write best so
provided."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref16" id="fnref16"

</div>

<p>The "Historical Tragedies" here foreshadowed, <i>King Victor and King
Charles</i> and <i>The Return of the Druses</i>, were eventually
published as the Second and Fourth of the <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>,
in 1842-43. How little Browning cared for history except as a quarry for
psychical problems, how little concern he had at bottom with the
changing drama of national life, is clear from the directions in which
he now sought his good. In <i>Strafford</i> as in <i>Paracelsus</i>, and
even in <i>Sordello</i>, the subject had made some appeal to the
interest in great epochs and famous men. Henceforth his attitude, as a
dramatist, to history is a curious blend of the historical specialist
who explores the recondite byways of history, and the romantic poet who
abandons actuality altogether. He seeks his heroes in remote sequestered
corners of the world,&mdash;Sardinia, Juliers, Lebanon; but actual
historic research gradually yields ground to a free invention which,
however, always simulates historic truth. <i>King Victor and King
Charles</i> contains far less poetry than <i>Paracelsus</i>, but it was
the fruit of historic studies no less severe. There was material for
genuine tragedy in the story. The old king, who after fifty years of
despotic rule shifts the crown to the head of his son with the intention
of still pulling the wires behind the scenes, but, finding that Charles
means to rule as well as reign, clutches angrily at his surrendered
crown,&mdash;this <a name="page46" id="page46">King</a> Victor has
something in him of Lear, something of the dying Henry IV. But history
provided more sober issues, and Browning's temperament habitually
inclined him to stave off the violence of tragic passion which disturbs
the subtle eddyings of thought and feeling. Charles is no Regan, hardly
even an Albany, no weakling either, but a man of sensitive conscience,
who shifts and gyrates responsively to the complex play of motive which
Browning brings to bear upon him. Reluctantly he orders Victor's arrest,
and when the old man, baffled and exasperated, is brought before him and
imperiously demands the crown, he puts it upon his father's head.
Neither character is drawn with the power of Strafford, but the play is
largely built upon the same contrasts between personal devotion and
political expediency, the untutored idealism of youth and the ruses or
rigidity of age. This was a type of dramatic action which Browning
imagined with peculiar power and insight, for it bodied forth a contrast
between contending elements of his own nature. Towards this type all his
drama tended to gravitate. In <i>The Return of the Druses</i> Browning's
native bent can be more freely studied, for history has contributed only
the general situation. His turn for curious and far-fetched incident is
nowhere better illustrated than in this tangled intrigue carried on
between Frankish Hospitallers, Venetians, and Druses of Lebanon in a
lonely island of the Aegean where none of the three are at home. A
political revolution&mdash;the revolt of the Druses against their
Frankish <a name="page47" id="page47">lords</a>&mdash;provides the outer
momentum of the action; but the central interest is concentrated upon a
"Soul's tragedy," in which the conflict of races goes on within the
perplexed and paralysed bosom of a single man. Djabal, the Druse patriot
brought up in Brittany, analyses his own character with the merciless
self-consciousness of Browning himself:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"I with my Arab instinct&mdash;thwarted ever<br />
      By my Frank policy, and with in turn<br />
      My Frank brain thwarted by my Arab heart&mdash;<br />
      While these remained in equipoise, I lived&mdash;<br />
      Nothing; had either been predominant,<br />
      As a Frank schemer or an Arab mystic<br />
      I had been something."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The conflict between policy and devotion is now
transferred to the arena of a single breast, where its nature is
somewhat too clearly understood and formulated. The "Frank schemer"
conceives the plan of turning the Druse superstition to account by
posing as an incarnation of their Founder. But the "Arab mystic" is too
near sharing the belief to act his part with ease, and while he is still
paltering the devoted Anael slays the Prefect. The play is thenceforth
occupied, ostensibly, with the efforts of the Christian authorities to
discover and punish the murderers. Its real subject is the subtle
changes wrought in Djabal and Anael by their gradual transition from the
relation of prophet and devotee to that of lovers. Her passion, even
before he comes to share it, has begun to sap the security of his false
<a name="page48" id="page48">pretensions:</a> he longs, not at first to
disavow them, but to make them true: he will be the prophetic helper of
his people in very deed. To the outer world he maintains his claim with
undiminished boldness and complete success; but the inner supports are
gradually giving way, Arab mystic and Frank schemer lose their hold,
and</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"A third and better nature rises up,<br />
      My mere man's nature."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Anael, a simpler character than any previous woman
of the plays, thus has a more significant function. Lady Carlisle
fumbles blindly with the dramatic issues without essentially affecting
them; Polyxena furthers them with loyal counsel, but is not their main
executant. Anael, in her fervid devotion, not only precipitates the
catastrophe, but emancipates her lover from the thraldom of his lower
nature. In her Browning for the first time in drama represented the
purifying power of Love. The transformations of soul by soul were
already beginning to occupy Browning's imagination. The poet of
<i>Cristina</i> and <i>Saul</i> was already foreshadowed. But nothing as
yet foreshadowed the kind of spiritual influence there
portrayed&mdash;that which, instead of making its way through
the impact of character upon character, passion upon passion, is
communicated through an unconscious glance or a song. For one who
believed as fixedly as Browning in the power of these moments to change
the prevailing bias of character and conduct, such a conception was full
of implicit drama. A chance <a name="page49" id="page49">inspiration</a>
led him to attempt to show how a lyric soul flinging its soul-seed
unconsciously forth in song might become the involuntary <i>deus ex
machina</i> in the tangle of passion and plot through which she moved,
resolving its problems and averting its catastrophes.</p>

<p>The result was a poem which Elizabeth Barrett "could find it in her
heart to envy" its author, which Browning himself (in 1845) liked better
than anything else he had yet done.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref17"
id="fnref17" href="#fn17">[17]</a></span> It has won a not less secure
place in the affections of all who care for Browning at all. It was
while walking alone in a wood near Dulwich, we are told by Mrs Orr, that
"the idea flashed upon him of some one walking thus through life; one
apparently too obscure to leave a trace of his or her passage, yet
exercising a lasting though unconscious influence at every step of it;
and the image shaped itself into the little silk-winder of Asolo."<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref18" id="fnref18" href="#fn18">[18]</a></span>
The most important effect of this design was to call out Browning's
considerable powers of rendering those gross, lurid, unspiritualised
elements of the human drama upon which Pippa was to flash her
transforming spell. His somewhat burly jocosity had expatiated freely in
letters; but he had done nothing which, like the cynical chaff of his
art students, suggests the not unskilful follower of Balzac and Dickens.
And he had given no hint of the elemental tragic power shown in the
great Ottima and Sebald scene, nor of the fierce and cruel sensuality,
the magnificence in sin, of Ottima herself.</p>

</div>

<a name="page50" id="page50"></a>
<p><i>Pippa Passes</i>, the most romantic in conception of all
Browning's plays, thus first disclosed his genius for realism.
<i>Strafford</i>, <i>King Victor</i>, <i>The Druses</i> are couched in
the tempered ideality of blank verse; here we pass to and fro from the
airiest lyric to the most massive and sinewy prose. It counted for
something, too, that Italy, and above all the little hill-town in which
the scene was laid, was a vivid personal memory, not a vague region of
fancy like his Sardinia or Lebanon. Asolo, with its walls and turret,
its bishop's palace and duomo, and girls sitting on the steps, its
upland farms among the cherry orchards, its beetles sparkling along the
dust, its "warm slow yellow moonlit nights" of May, and "glaring pomps"
of June,&mdash;Asolo, with its legend of "Kate the queen" and her
carolling page, lives as few other spots do for Browning's readers.
Pippa herself, in her exquisite detachment from the sordid humanity amid
which she moves, might have appeared too like a visionary presence, not
of earth though on it, had she not been brought into touch, at so many
points, with things that Browning had seen. <i>Pippa Passes</i> has,
among Browning's dramas, the same kind of peculiar interest which
belongs to the <i>Tempest</i> and to <i>Faust</i> among Shakespeare's
and Goethe's. Faery and devilry were not Browning's affair; but, within
the limits of his resolute humanism, <i>Pippa Passes</i> is an ideal
construction, shadowing forth, under the semblance of a single definite
bit of life, the controlling elements, as <a name="page51"
id="page51">Browning</a> imagined them, in all life. For Browning, too,
the world teemed with Stephanos and Trinculos, Sebastians and Antonios;
it was, none the less, a magical Isle, where strange catastrophes and
unsuspected revolutions sprang suddenly into being at the unseen carol
of Ariel as he passed. Browning's Ariel is the organ of a spiritual
power which, unlike Prospero, seeks not merely to detect and avert
crime, or merely to dismiss the would-be criminal, forgiven, to "live
and deal with others better," but to renovate character; to release men
from the bondage of their egoisms by those influences, slight as a
flower-bell or a sunset touch, which renew us by setting all our aims
and desires in a new proportion.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Browning's first four plays seemed to mark a growing neglect of the
requirements and traditions of the stage. He might even appear to have
renounced the stage altogether when in 1841 he arranged with Moxon to
publish his writings in a cheap pamphlet form. The first number of
<i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> contained the least theatrical of his
dramas, <i>Pippa Passes</i>. "Two or three years ago" he declared in the
preface (not reprinted), "I wrote a play, about which the chief matter I
much care to recollect at present is that a Pit-full of good-natured
people applauded it. Ever since I have been desirous of doing something
in the same way that should better <a name="page52" id="page52">reward</a>
their attention. What follows I mean for the first of a series of
Dramatical Pieces, to come out at intervals; and I amuse myself by
fancying that the cheap mode in which they appear will for once help me
to a sort of Pit-audience again."</p>

<p>But Browning's ambition for fame as a maker of plays was still keen,
and nothing but a renewed invitation to write for the stage was needed to
lure him back into tentative compliance with its ways. In the course of
1841 Macready intervened with a request for another play from the author
of <i>Strafford</i>.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref19" id="fnref19"
href="#fn19">[19]</a></span> Thereupon Browning produced with great
rapidity <i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i>. After prolonged and somewhat
sordid green-room vicissitudes, it was performed on Feb. 11, 1843.
Macready, its first begetter, did his best to wreck it; the majority of
the players refused to understand their parts; but through the fine
acting of Helen Faucit (Mildred) and Phelps (Lord Tresham), it achieved
a moderate but brief success.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn19" id="fn19" href="#fnref19">[19]</a></span>
The date is fixed by Browning's statement (Orr, p. 119).
</div>

<p>The choice of subject indicates, as has been said, a desire to make
terms with stage tradition. But the ordinary theatre-goer, who went
expecting to witness what the title appeared to promise, found himself,
as the play proceeded, perplexed and out of his bearings. An English
nobleman, with the deep-engrained family pride of his order, had
suffered, or was to suffer, dishonour. But this seemingly commonplace
<i>motif</i> was developed in a strange and unfamiliar ethical
atmosphere&mdash;an <a name="page53" id="page53">atmosphere</a> of moral
ideas which seemed to embrace both those who upheld the feudal honour
and those who "blotted" it; to hint at a purity deeper than sin. In a
more sinister sense than <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>, this play might have
been prefaced by the beautiful motto of its successor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Ivy and violet, what do ye here<br />
      With blossom and shoot in the warm spring weather<br />
      Hiding the arms of Montecchi and Vere?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The love of Mildred and Mertoun, which blots the
Tresham 'scutcheon, is in origin as innocent as that which breaks into
flower across the royal ambitions of Colombe; and their childlike purity
of passion becomes, in spite of the wrong to which it has led them, the
reconciling fact upon which at the close all animosities and resentments
die away. The conception is genuinely tragic, for the doom which
descends upon them all is a Nemesis which they have all contributed to
provoke, but which none of them deserves; and which precisely the
blended nobility and naïveté of Mildred and Mertoun prevents from
passing by them altogether. More mature or less sensitive lovers would
have found an issue from the situation as easily as an ordinary Hamlet
from his task of vengeance. But Mertoun and Mildred are at once too
timid and too audacious, too tremulous in their consciousness of guilt,
too hardy and reckless in their mutual devotion, to carry through so
difficult a game. Mertoun falters and stammers in his suit to Tresham;
Mildred stands mute at her brother's charge,
<a name="page54" id="page54">incapable</a> of evasion, only resolute not
to betray. Yet these same two children in the arts of politic
self-defence are found recklessly courting the peril of midnight
meetings in Mildred's chamber with the aid of all the approved resources
and ruses of romance&mdash;the disguise, the convenient tree, the signal
set in the window, the lover's serenade. And when the lover, who dared
all risks to his lady and to himself for a stolen interview with her
night by night, finally encounters Tresham, he is instantly paralysed,
and will not even lift a sword in his own defence. Upon this union of
boundless daring for one another's sake and sensibility to the shame of
having wronged the house and blotted the 'scutcheon Mertoun's fate
hangs, and with his Mildred's, and with hers Tresham's.</p>

<p>Beside the tragedy and the stain of the love of Mertoun and Mildred,
Browning characteristically sets the calm, immaculate, cousinly
affection of Gwendolen and Austin. One has a glimpse here of his
habitual criticism of all satisfied attainment, of all easy completeness
on a low plane. It is Gwendolen herself who half disarms that criticism,
or makes it, as applied to her, more pathetic than trenchant by
instantly detecting and proclaiming the different quality of Mertoun's
love. "Mark him, Austin: that's true love! Ours must begin again." In
Tresham Browning seems to have designed to portray the finest type of
ancestral pride. He is "proud" of his "interminable line," because the
men were all "paladins" and the women all of flawless
<a name="page55" id="page55">honour;</a> and he has the chivalrous
tenderness of ideal knighthood, as well as its honourable pride. When
Mertoun has received his death-stroke and told his story, the tenderness
comes out; the sullied image of his passionately loved sister not only
recovers its appeal, but rises up before him in mute intolerable
reproach; and Mildred has scarcely breathed her last in his arms when
Tresham succumbs to the poison he has taken in remorse for his hasty
act. It is unlucky that this tragic climax, finely conceived as it is,
is marred by the unconscious burlesque of his "Ah,&mdash;I had
forgotten: I am dying." In such things one feels Browning's want of the
unerring sureness of a great dramatist at the crucial moments of action.</p>

<p>Although not brilliantly successful on the boards, <i>A Blot in the
'Scutcheon</i> made a deep impression upon the more competent part of the
audience. For Browning himself the most definite result was that
Macready passed out of his life&mdash;for twenty years they never
met&mdash;and that his most effective link with the stage was thus
finally severed. But his more distant and casual relations with it were
partly balanced by the much enlarged understanding of dramatic effect
which he had by this time won; and <i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i> was
followed by a drama which attains a beauty and charm not far below that
of <i>Pippa Passes</i> under the conditions of a regular dramatic plot.
The ostensible subject of <i>Colombe's Birthday</i> is a political
crisis on the familiar lines;&mdash;an imperilled throne in the centre
of <a name="page56" id="page56">interest,</a> a background of vague
oppression and revolt. But as compared with <i>King Victor</i> or <i>The
Druses</i> the dispute is harmless, the tumult of revolution easily
overheard. The diplomatic business is not etherealised into romance,
like the ladies' embassy in <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>; but neither is
it allowed to become grave or menacing. Berthold's arrival to present his
claim to the government of this miniature state affects us somewhat like
the appearance of a new and formidable player in some drawing-room
diversion; and the "treason" of the courtiers like the "unfairness" of
children at play. Nevertheless, the victory of love over political
interest which the motto foreshadows is not accomplished without those
subtle fluctuations and surprises which habitually mark the conduct of
Browning's plots. The alternative issues gain in seriousness and
ideality as we proceed, and Browning has nowhere expressed the ideal of
sovereignty more finely than it is expressed in this play, by the man
for whose sake a sovereign is about to surrender her
crown.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref20" id="fnref20"
href="#fn20">[20]</a></span> Colombe herself is one of Browning's most
gracious and winning figures. She brings the ripe decision of womanhood
to bear upon a series of difficult situations without losing the bright
glamour of her youth. Her inborn truth and nature draw her on as by a
quiet <a name="page57" id="page57">momentum</a>, and gradually
liberate her from the sway of the hollow fictions among which her lot is
cast. Valence, the outward instrument of this liberation, is not the
least noble of that line of chivalrous lovers which reaches from Gismond
to Caponsacchi. With great delicacy the steps are marked in this inward
and spiritual "flight" of Colombe. Valence's "way of love" is to make
her realise the glory and privileges of the rulership which places her
beyond his reach, at the very moment when she is about to resign it in
despair. She discovers the needs of the woman and the possibilities of
power at the same time, and thus is brought, by Valence's means, to a
mood in which Prince Berthold's offer of his hand and crown together
weighs formidably, for a moment, against Valence's offer of his love
alone, until she discovers that Berthold is the very personation, in
love and in statecraft alike, of the fictions from which she had
escaped. Then, swiftly recovering herself, she sets foot finally on the
firm ground where she had first sought her "true resource."</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn20" id="fn20" href="#fnref20">[20]</a></span>
This fine speech of Valence to the greater glory of his
rival (Act iv.) is almost too subtle for the stage. Browning with good
reason directed its omission unless "a very good Valence" could be
found.
</div>

<p>Berthold, like Blougram, Ogniben, and many another of Browning's
mundane personages, is a subtler piece of psychology than men of the
type of Valence, in whom his own idealism flows freely forth. He comes
before us with a weary nonchalance admirably contrasted with the fiery
intensity of Valence. He means to be emperor one day, and his whole life
is a process of which that is to be the product; but he finds the process
unaffectedly boring. Without relaxing a whit in the mechanical
<a name="page58" id="page58">pursuit</a> of his end, he views life with
much mental detachment, and shows a cool and not unsympathetic
observation of men who pursue other ideals, as well as an abundance of
critical irony towards those who apparently share his own. An adept in
courtly arts, and owing all his successes to courtly favour, he meets
the assiduities of other courtiers with open contempt. His ends are
those of Laertes or Fortinbras, and he is quite capable of the methods
of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern; but he regards ends and methods alike
with the sated distaste of Hamlet. By birth and principle a man of
action, he has, even more than most of Browning's men
of action, the curious introspectiveness of the philosophic onlooker. He
"watches his mind," and if he does not escape illusions, recognises and
exposes them with ironical candour. Few of Browning's less right-minded
persons attain final insight at less cost to dramatic propriety than
Berthold when he pronounces his final verdict:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in8">"All is for the best.</span><br />
      Too costly a flower were this, I see it now,<br />
      To pluck and set upon my barren helm<br />
      To wither,&mdash;any garish plume will do."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Colombe's Birthday</i> was published in 1844 as No. 6 of the
<i>Bells</i>, but had for the present no prospect of the stage. Nine
years later, however, the loyal Phelps, who had so doughtily come to the
rescue of its predecessor, put it successfully on the boards of his
theatre at Sadler's Wells.</p>

<a name="page59" id="page59"></a>
<p>The most buoyant of optimists has moments of self-mockery, and the
hardiest believer in ideal truth moods in which poetry seems the phantom
and prose the fact. Such a mood had its share in colouring the dramatic
sketch which, it is now pretty evident, Browning wrote not long after
finishing <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>.<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref21" id="fnref21" href="#fn21">[21]</a></span>
That play is a beautiful triumph of poetry over prose, of soul and heart
over calculation and business. <i>A Soul's Tragedy</i> exhibits the
inverse process: the triumph of mundane policy and genial <i>savoir
faire</i> in the person of Ogniben over the sickly and equivocal
"poetry" of Chiappino. Browning seems to have thrown off this bitter
parody of his own idealisms in a mood like that in which Ibsen conceived
the poor blundering idealist of the <i>Wild Duck</i>. Chiappino is
Browning's Werle; the reverse side of a type which he had drawn with so
much indulgence in the Luigi of <i>Pippa Passes</i>. Plainly, it was a
passing mood; as plainly, a mood which, from the high and luminous
vantage-ground of 1846, he could look back upon with regret, almost with
scorn. His intercourse with Elizabeth Barrett was far advanced before
she was at length reluctantly allowed to see it. "For <i>The Soul's
<a name="page60" id="page60">Tragedy</a></i>," he wrote
(Feb. 11)&mdash;"that will surprise you, I think. There is no trace of
you there,&mdash;you have not put out the black face of
<i>it</i>&mdash;it is all sneering and disillusion&mdash;and shall not be
printed but burned if you say the word." This word his correspondent,
needless to add, did not say; on the contrary, she found it even more
impressive than its successor <i>Luria</i>. This was, however, no
tribute to its stage qualities; for in hardly one of his plays is the
stage more openly ignored. The dramatic form, though still preserved,
sets strongly towards monologue; the entire second act foreshadows
unmistakably the great portrait studies of <i>Men and Women</i>; it
might be called <i>Ogniben</i> with about as good right as they are
called <i>Lippo Lippi</i> or <i>Blougram</i>; the personality of the
supple ecclesiastic floods and takes possession of the entire scene; we
see the situation and the persons through the brilliant ironic mirror of
his mind. The Chiappino of the second act is Ogniben's Chiappino, as
Gigadibs is Blougram's Gigadibs. His "tragedy" is one in which there is
no room for terror or pity, only for contempt. All real stress of
circumstance is excluded. Both sides fight with blunted weapons; the
revolt is like one of those Florentine risings which the Brownings later
witnessed with amusement from the windows of Casa Guidi, which were
liable to postponement because of rain. The prefect who is
"assassinated" does not die, and the rebellious city is genially
bantered into submission. The "soul" of Chiappino is, in fact,
not the <a name="page61" id="page61">stuff</a> of which tragedy is made.
Even in his instant acceptance of Luitolfo's bloodstained cloak when the
pursuers are, as he thinks, at the door, he seems to have been casually
switched off the proper lines of his character into a piece of heroism
which properly belongs to the man he would like to be thought, but has
not the strength to be. On the whole, Browning's scorn must be
considered to have injured his art. Tragedy, in the deepest sense, lay
beyond his sphere; and this "tragedy" of mere degeneration and helpless
collapse left untouched all the springs from which his poetry drew its
life.</p>

Browning's letter to Elizabeth Barrett, Feb. 13, 1846,
which does not seem to have been adequately noticed. The piece is
ignored by Mrs Orr. He speaks of suspending the publication of the
"unlucky play" until a second edition of the <i>Bells</i>&mdash;an
"apparition" which Moxon, he says, seems to think possible; and then
inserting it before <i>Luria</i>: it will then be "in its place, for it
was written two or three years ago." In other words, <i>The Soul's
Tragedy</i> was written in 1843-44, between <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>
and <i>Luria</i>.
</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1844 Browning made a second tour to Italy. It was
chiefly memorable for his meeting, at Leghorn, with Edward John
Trelawney, to whom he carried a letter of introduction;&mdash;one who
had not only himself "seen Shelley plain," but has contributed more than
any one else, save Hogg, to flash the unfading image of what he saw on
the eyes of posterity. The journey quickened and enriched his Italian
memories; and left many vivid traces in the poetry of the following
year. Among these was the drama of <i>Luria</i>, ultimately published as
the concluding number of the <i>Bells</i>.</p>

<p>In this remarkable drama Browning turned once more to the type of
historical tragedy which he had originally essayed in <i>Strafford</i>.
The fall of a man of passionate fidelity through the treachery of the
prince or the people in whom he has put his trust, was for Browning one
of the most arresting of the great traditional motives of
<a name="page62" id="page62">tragic</a> drama. He dwelt with emphasis
upon this aspect of the fate of Charles's great minister; in
<i>Luria</i>, where he was working uncontrolled by historical
authority, it is the fundamental theme. At the same time the effect is
heightened by those race contrasts which had been so abundantly used in
<i>The Return of the Druses</i>. Luria is a Moor who has undertaken the
service of Florence, and whose religion it is to serve her. Like
Othello,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref22" id="fnref22"
href="#fn22">[22]</a></span> he has been intrusted, alien as he is, by a
jealous and exacting State, with the supreme command of her military
forces, a position in which the fervour of the Oriental and the frank
simplicity of the soldier inevitably lie open to the subtle strategy of
Italians and statesmen. "Luria," wrote Browning, while the whole scheme
was "all in my brain yet, ... devotes himself to something he thinks
Florence, and the old fortune follows, ... and I will soon loosen my
Braccio and Puccio (a pale discontented man) and Tiburzio (the Pisan,
good true fellow, this one), and Domizia the lady&mdash;loosen all these
on dear foolish (ravishing must his folly be) golden-hearted Luria, all
these with their worldly wisdom and Tuscan shrewd ways." Florence, in
short, plays collectively somewhat the part of Iago to this second
Othello, but of an Iago (need it be said) immeasurably less deeply
rooted in malignity than Shakespeare's. It was a source of weakness as
well as of strength in Browning as a dramatist that the
<a name="page63" id="page63">evil</a> things in men
dissolve so readily under his scrutiny as if they were mere shells of
flimsy disguise for the "soul of goodness" they contain. He has, in
fact, put so much strong sense on the side of the jealous Florentine
masters of his hero that his own sympathies were divided, with
paralysing effect, it would seem, upon his interest in drama.<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref23" id="fnref23" href="#fn23">[23]</a></span>
Even the formidable antagonism of Braccio, the Florentine Commissary, is
buttressed, if not based, upon a resolve to defend the rights of
civilisation against militarism, of intellect against brute force.
"Brute force shall not rule Florence." Even so, it is only after
conflict and fluctuation that he decides to allow Luria's trial to take
its course. Puccio, again, the former general of Florence, superseded by
Luria, and now serving under his command, turns out not quite the "pale
discontented man" whom Browning originally designed and whom such a
situation was no doubt calculated to produce. Instead of a Cassius,
enviously scowling at the greatness of his former comrade, Cæsar, we
have one whose generous admiration for the alien set over him struggles
hard, and not unsuccessfully, with natural resentment. In keeping with
such company is the noble Pisan general, who vies with Luria in
generosity and twice intervenes decisively to save him from the
Florentine attack. Even Domizia, the <a name="page64"
id="page64">"panther"</a> lady who comes to the camp burning for
vengeance upon Florence for the death of her kinsmen, and hoping to
attain it by embroiling him with the city, finally emerges as his lover.
But in Domizia he confessedly failed. The correspondence with Miss
Barrett stole the vitality from all mere imaginary women; "the panther
would not be tamed." Her hatred and her love alike merely beat the air.
With all her volubility, she is almost as little in place in the economy
of the drama as in that of the camp; her "wild mass of rage" has the air
of being a valued property which she manages and exhibits, not an
impelling and consuming fire. The more potent passion of Luria and his
lieutenant Husain is more adequately rendered, though "the simple
Moorish instinct" in them is made to accomplish startling feats in
European subtlety. The East with its gift of "feeling" comes once more,
as in the <i>Druses</i>, into tragic contact with the North and its gift
of "thought"; but it is to the feeling East and not to thinking North
that we owe the clear analysis and exposition of the contrast. Luria has
indeed, like Djabal, assimilated just so much of European culture as
makes its infusion fatal to him: he suffers the doom of the lesser race</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Which when it apes the greater is forgone."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the noblest quality of the lesser race flashes
forth at the close when he takes his life, not in defiance, nor in
despair, but as a last act of passionate fidelity to
<a name="page65" id="page65">Florence</a>. This is conceived with a
refinement of moral imagination too subtle perhaps for appreciation on
the stage; but of the tragic power and pathos of the conception there
can be no question. Mrs Browning, whose eager interest accompanied this
drama through every stage of its progress, justly dwelt upon its
"grandeur." The busy exuberance of Browning's thinking was not
favourable to effects which multiplicity of detail tends to destroy; but
the fate of this son of the "lone and silent East," though utterly
un-Shakespearean in motive, recalls, more nearly than anything else in
Browning's dramas, the heroic tragedy of Shakespeare.</p>

<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn22" id="fn22" href="#fnref22">[22]</a></span>
Browning himself uses this parallel in almost his first
reference to <i>Luria</i> while still unwritten: <i>Letters of R.B. and
E.B.B.</i>, i. 26.

"For me, the misfortune is, I sympathise just as much with
these as with him,&mdash;so there can no good come of keeping this wild
company any longer."&mdash;Feb. 26, 1845.

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>"Mere escapes of my inner power, like the light of a revolving
lighthouse leaping out at intervals from a narrow chink;" so wrote
Browning in effect to Miss Barrett (Feb. 11, 1845) of the "scenes and
song-scraps," of which the first instalment had appeared three years
before as the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>. Yet it is just by the intermittent
flashes that the lighthouse is identified; and Browning's genius, as we
have seen, was in the end to be most truly denoted by these "mere
escapes." With a few notable exceptions, they offer little to the
student of Browning's ideology; they do not illustrate his theories of
life, they disclose no good in evil and no hope in ill-success. But they
are full of an exuberant joy in life itself, as seen by a keen observer
<a name="page66" id="page66">exempt</a> from its harsher conditions, to
whom all power and passion are a feast. He watches the angers, the
malignities of men and women, as one might watch the quarrels of wild
beasts, not cynically, but with the detached, as it were professional,
interest of a born "fighter." The loftier hatred, which is a form of
love,&mdash;the sublime hatred of a Dante, the tragic hatred of a Timon,
even the unforgetting, self-consuming hatred of a Heathcliff,&mdash;did
not now, or ever, engage his imagination. The indignant invective
against a political renegade, "Just for a handful of silver he left us,"
in which Browning spoke his own mind, is poor and uncharacteristic
compared with pieces in which he stood aside and let some accomplished
devil, like the Duke in <i>My last Duchess</i>, some clerical libertine,
like the bishop of St Praxed's, some sneaking reptile, like the Spanish
friar, some tiger-hearted Regan, like the lady of <i>The Laboratory</i>,
or some poor crushed and writhing worm, like the girl of <i>The
Confessional</i>, utter their callous cynicism or their deathbed
torment, the snarl of petty spite, the low fierce cry of triumphant
malice, the long-drawn shriek of futile rage. There was commonly an
element of unreason, extravagance, even grotesqueness, in the hatreds
that caught his eye; he had a relish for the gratuitous savagery of the
lady in <i>Time's Revenges</i>, who would calmly decree that
her lover should be burnt in a slow fire "if that would compass her
desire." He seized the grotesque side of persecution; and it is not
fanciful to see in the <a name="page67" id="page67">delightful</a>
chronicle of the Nemesis inflicted upon "Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis" a
foretaste of the sardonic confessions of <i>Instans Tyrannus</i>. And he
seized the element of sheer physical zest in even eager and impassioned
action; the tramp of the march, the swing of the gallop in the fiery
Cavalier Tunes, the crash of Gismond's "back&mdash;handed blow" upon
Gauthier's mouth; the exultant lift of the "great pace" of the riders
who bring the Good News.</p>

<p>Of love poetry, on the other hand, there was little in these first
Lyrics and Romances. Browning had had warm friendships with women, and
was singularly attractive to them; but at thirty-three love had at most
sent a dancing ripple across the bright surface of his life, and it
apparently counted for nothing in his dreams. His plans, as he told Miss
Barrett, had been made without any thought of "finding such a one as
you." That discovery introduced a new and unknown factor into his scheme
of things. The love-poetry of the Dramatic Lyrics and Romances is still
somewhat tentative and insecure. The beautiful fantasia <i>In a Gondola</i>
was directly inspired by a picture of his friend Maclise. He paints the
romance of the lover's twilight tryst with all his incisive vigour; but
his own pulse beats rather with the lover who goes forth at daybreak,
and feels the kindling summons of the morning glory of sea and sunlight
into the "world of men." His attitude to women is touched with the
virginal reserve of the young Hippolytus, whose tragic fate he had told
in <a name="page68" id="page68">the</a> lofty <i>Prologue</i> of
Artemis. He approaches them with a kind of delicate and distant awe;
tender, even chivalrous, but accentuating rather the reserves and
reticences of chivalry than its rewards. The lady of <i>The Flower's
Name</i> is beautiful, but her beauty is only shyly hinted; we see no
feature of face or form; only the fold of her dress brushing against the
box border, the "twinkling" of her white fingers among the dark leaves.
The typical lover of these lyrics is of a temperament in which feminine
sensitiveness and masculine tenacity are characteristically blended; a
temperament which the faintest and most fugitive signs of love&mdash;a
word, a glance, the impalpable music of a romantic name&mdash;not only
kindle and subdue, but permanently fortify and secure. <i>Cristina</i>,
<i>Rudel</i>, and the <i>Lost Mistress</i> stand in a line of
development which culminates in <i>The Last Ride Together</i>. Cristina's
lover has but "changed eyes" with her; but no queenly scorn of hers can
undo the spiritual transformation which her glance has wrought:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Her soul's mine; and thus, grown perfect,<br />
      I shall pass my life's remainder."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The <i>Lost Mistress</i> is an exquisitely tender
and pathetic farewell, but not the stifled cry of a man who has received
a crushing blow. Not easily, but yet without any ruinous convulsion, he
makes that transition from love to "mere friendship" which passionate
men so hardly endure.</p>

<a name="page69" id="page69"></a>
<p>The really tragic love-story was, for Browning, the story not of love
rejected but of love flagging, fading, or crushed out.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Never fear, but there's provision<br />
      Of the devil's to quench knowledge<br />
      Lest on earth we walk in rapture,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Cristina's lover had bitterly reflected. Courts, as
the focuses of social artifice and ceremonial restraint, were for him
the peculiar breeding-places of such tragedies, and in several of the
most incisive of the Lyrics and Romances he appears as the champion of
the love they menace. The hapless <i>Last Duchess</i> suffers for the
largess of her kindly smiles. The duchess of <i>The Flight</i> and the
lady of <i>The Glove</i> successfully revolt against pretentious
substitutes for love offered in love's name. <i>The Flight</i> is a
tale, as Mrs Browning said, "with a great heart in it." Both the
Gipsy-woman whose impassioned pleading we overhear, and the old Huntsman
who reports it, are drawn from a domain of rough and simple humanity not
very often trodden by Browning. The genial retainer admirably mediates
between the forces of the Court which he serves and those of the wild
primitive race to which his world-old calling as a hunter makes him kin;
his hearty, untutored speech and character envelop the story like an
atmosphere, and create a presumption that heart and nature will
ultimately have their way. Even the hinted landscape-background serves
as a mute chorus. In this "great wild country" of wide
<a name="page70" id="page70">forests</a> and pine-clad mountains, the
court is the anomaly.</p>

<p>Similarly, in <i>The Glove</i>, the lion, so magnificently sketched by
Browning, is made to bear out the inner expressiveness of the tale in a
way anticipated by no previous teller. The lion of Schiller's ballad is
already assuaged to his circumstances, and enters the arena like a
courtier entering a drawing-room. Browning's lion, still terrible and
full of the tameless passion for freedom, bursts in with flashing
forehead, like the spirit of the desert of which he dreams: it is the
irruption of this mighty embodiment of elemental Nature which wakens in
the lady the train of feeling and thought that impel her daring
vindication of its claims.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Art was far from being as strange to the Browning of 1842-45 as love.
But he seized with a peculiar predilection those types and phases of the
Art-world with which love has least to do. He studies the egoisms of
artists, the vanities of connoisseurs; the painter Lutwyche showing "how
he can hate"; the bishop of St Praxed's piteously bargaining on his
death-bed for the jasper and lapislazuli "which Gandolph shall not
choose but see and burst"; the duke of the <i>Last Duchess</i>
displaying his wife's portrait as the wonder of his gallery, and
unconcernedly disposing of her person. In a single poem only Browning
touches those problems of the artist life which were to occupy him in
the 'Fifties; and the <i>Pictor Ignotus</i> is as far behind the
<i>Andrea del <a name="page71" id="page71">Sarto</a></i> and
<i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i> in intellectual force as in dramatic brilliance
and plasticity. Browning's sanguine and energetic temperament always
inclined him to over-emphasis, and he has somewhat over-emphasised the
anæmia of this anæmic soul. Rarely again did he paint in such resolute
uniformity of ashen grey. The "Pictor" is the earliest, and the palest,
of Browning's pale ascetics, who make, in one way or another, the great
refusal, and lose their souls by trying to save them in a barrenness
which they call purity.</p>

<p>The musician as such holds at this stage an even smaller place in
Browning's art than the painter. None of these Lyrics foreshadows <i>Abt
Vogler</i> and <i>Hugues of Saxe-Gotha</i> as the <i>Pictor</i>
foreshadows <i>Lippi</i> and <i>Del Sarto</i>. But if he did not as yet
explore the ways of the musical soul, he shows already a peculiar
instinct for the poetic uses and capabilities of music. He sings with
peculiar <i>entrain</i> of the transforming magic of song. The thrush
and cuckoo, among the throng of singing-birds, attract him by their
musicianly qualities&mdash;the "careless rapture" repeated, the "minor
third" <i>which only the cuckoo knows</i>. These Lyrics and Romances of
1842-45 are as full of tributes to the power of music as
<i>L'Allegro</i> and <i>Il Penseroso</i> themselves. Orpheus,
whose story Milton there touched so ravishingly, was too trite an
instance to arrest Browning; it needed perhaps the stimulus of his
friend Leighton's picture to call forth, long afterwards, the few choice
verses on Eurydice. More to his mind was the legend of that motley
Orpheus <a name="page72" id="page72">of</a> the North, the Hamelin
piper,&mdash;itself a picturesque motley of laughter and tears. The
Gipsy's lay of far-off romance awakens the young duchess; Theocrite's
"little human praise" wins God's ear, and Pippa's songs transform the
hearts of men. A poet in this vein would fall naturally enough upon the
Biblical story of the cure of the stricken Saul by the songs of the boy
David. But a special influence drew Browning to this subject,&mdash;the
wonderful <i>Song to David</i> of Christopher Smart,&mdash;"a person of
importance in his day," who owes it chiefly to Browning's enthusiastic
advocacy of a poem he was never weary of declaiming, that he is a poet
of importance in ours. Smart's David is before all things the glowing
singer of the Joy of Earth,&mdash;the glory of the visible creation
uttering itself in rapturous Praise of the Lord. And it is this David of
whom we have a presentiment in the no less glowing songs with which
Browning's shepherd-boy seeks to reach the darkened mind of Saul.</p>

<p>Of the poem we now possess, only the first nine sections belong to the
present phase of Browning's work. These were confessedly incomplete, but
Browning was content to let them go forth as they were, and less bent
upon even their ultimate completion, it would seem, than Miss Barrett,
who bade him "remember" that the poem was "there only as a first part,
and that the next parts must certainly follow and complete what will be
a great lyrical work&mdash;now remember."<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref24" id="fnref24" href="#fn24">[24]</a></span>
And the "next parts" when they came, in <i>Men and Women</i>, bore the
mark <a name="page73" id="page73">of</a> his ten years' fellowship
with her devout and ecstatic soul, as well as of his own growth towards
the richer and fuller harmonies of verse. The 1845 fragment falls, of
course, far short of its sequel in imaginative audacity and splendour,
but it is steeped in a pellucid beauty which Browning's busy
intellectuality was too prone to dissipate. Kenyon read it nightly, as
he told Mrs Browning, "to put his dreams in order"; finely comparing it
to "Homer's Shield of Achilles, thrown into lyrical whirl and life." And
certainly, if Browning anywhere approaches that Greek plasticity for
which he cared so little, it is in these exquisitely sculptured yet
breathing scenes. Then, as the young singer kindles to his work, his
song, without becoming less transparent, grows more personal and
impassioned; he no longer repeats the familiar chants of his tribe, but
breaks into a new impetuous inspiration of his own; the lyrical whirl
and life gathers swiftness and energy, and the delicate bas-reliefs of
Saul's people, in their secular pieties of grief or joy, merge in the
ecstatic vision of Saul himself, as he had once been, and as he might
yet be, that</p>

<p class="noindent">all the fulness and glory of the life of humanity
gathered upon his single head. It is the very voice of life, which
thrills and strikes across the spiritual darkness of Saul, as the coming
of Hyperion scattered the shadows of Saturnian night.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> made no very great
way with the public, which found the matter unequal and the title
obscure. But both the title and the greater part of the single poems are
linked inseparably with the most intimate personal relationship of his
life. Hardly one of the Romances, as we saw, but had been read in MS. by
Elizabeth Barrett, and pronounced upon with the frank yet critical
delight of her nature. In the abstruse symbolic title,
too,&mdash;implying, as Browning expected his readers to discover,
"sound and sense" <a name="page75" id="page75">or</a> "music and
discoursing,"&mdash;her wit had divined a more felicitous application to
Browning's poetry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Some 'Pomegranate,' which, if cut deep down the
     middle,<br />
     Shows a heart within blood-tinctured, of a veined humanity."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The two poets were still strangers when this was
written; but each had for years recognised in the other a new and
wonderful poetic force,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref25"
id="fnref25" href="#fn25">[25]</a></span>
and the vivid words marked the profound community of spirit which was
finally to draw them together. A few years later, a basket of
pomegranates was handed to her, when travelling with her husband in
France, and she laughingly accepted the omen. The omen was fulfilled;
Elizabeth Browning's poetry expanded and matured in the companionship of
that rich-veined human heart; it was assuredly not by chance that
Browning, ten years after her death, recalled her symbol in the name of
his glorious woman-poet, Balaustion.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn25" id="fn25" href="#fnref25">[25]</a></span>
She had at once discerned the "new voice" in <i>Paracelsus</i>,
1835; and the occasion may have been not much later ("years ago" in
1845) on which he was all but admitted to the "shrine" of the "world's
wonder" (<i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i>, Jan. 10, 1845).
</div>

<p>But she, on her part, also brought a new and potent influence to bear
upon his poetry, the only one which after early manhood he ever
experienced; and their union was by far the most signal event in
Browning's intellectual history, as it was in his life. Her experience
up to the time when they met had been in most points
<a name="page76" id="page76">singularly</a> unlike
his own. Though of somewhat higher social status, she had seen far less
of society and of the world; but she had gone through the agony of a
passionately loved brother's sudden death, and the glory of English wood
and meadow was for her chiefly, as to Milton in his age, an enchanted
memory of earlier days, romantically illuminating a darkened London
chamber. "Most of my events, and nearly all my intense pleasures," she
said to Horne, "have passed in my thoughts." Both were eager students,
and merited the hazardous reputation which both incurred, of being
"learned poets"; but Browning wore his learning, not indeed "lightly,
like a flower," but with the cool mastery of a scholarly man of the
world, whose interpretation of books is controlled at every point by his
knowledge of men; while Miss Barrett's Greek and Hebrew chiefly served
to allure an imagination naturally ecstatic and visionary along paths
crowded with congenial unearthly symbols, with sublime shapes of gods
and Titans, angels and seraphim. Then, notwithstanding the <i>rôle</i> of
hopeless invalid which she was made to play, and did play with touching
conviction, she had, it is clear, a fund of buoyant and impulsive
vitality hardly inferior to Browning's own; only that the energy which
in him flowed out through natural channels had in her to create its own
opportunities, and surged forth with harsh or startling
violence,&mdash;sometimes "tearing open a parcel instead of untying it,"
and sometimes compelling words to serve her will by masterful audacities
of collocation. <a name="page77" id="page77">Both</a> poets stood apart
from most of their contemporaries by a certain exuberance&mdash;"a fine
excess"&mdash;quite foreign to the instincts of a generation which
repudiated the Revolution and did its best to repudiate Byron. But
Browning's exuberance was genial, hearty, and on occasion brutal; hers
was exalted, impulsive, "head-long,"<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref26" id="fnref26" href="#fn26">[26]</a></span>
intense, and often fantastic and quaint. His imagination flamed forth
like an intenser sunlight, heightening and quickening all that was alive
and alert in man and Nature; hers shot out superb or lurid volcanic
gleams across the simplicity of natural chiaro-oscuro, disturbing the
air with conflicting and incalculable effects of strange horror and
strange loveliness. It might have been averred of Browning that he said
everything he thought; of her the truer formula would be her own, that
she "took every means of saying" what she thought.<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref27" id="fnref27" href="#fn27">[27]</a></span>
There was something of Æschylus in her, as there was much of
Aristophanes in him; it was not for nothing that her girlish ardour had
twice flung itself upon the task of rendering the <i>Prometheus
Bound</i> in English; they met on common ground in the human and
pathetic Euripides. But her power was <a name="page78"
id="page78">lyric</a>, not dramatic. She sang from the depths of a
wonderfully rich and passionate nature; while he was most truly himself
when he was personating some imaginary mind.</p>

The word her Italian tutor meant to describe her by, but
could not pronounce it. He said she was <i>testa lunga</i> (<i>Letters
of R. and E.B.</i>, i. 7).
<br /><br />
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn27" id="fn27" href="#fnref27">[27]</a></span>
<i>Letters, R. and E.B.,</i> i. 8. Cf. her admirable letter to
Ruskin, ten years later, apropos of the charge of "affectation." "To say
a thing faintly, because saying it strongly sounds odd or obscure or
unattractive for some reason to careless readers, does appear to me bad
policy as well as bad art" (<i>Letters of E.B.B</i>., ii., 200).
</div>

<p>Early in January 1845 the two poets were brought by the genial Kenyon,
her cousin and his good friend, into actual communication, and the
memorable correspondence, the most famous of its kind in English
literature, at once began. Browning, as his way was in telling other
men's stories, burst at once <i>in medias res</i> in this great story of
his own. "I love your verses, my dear Miss Barrett, with all my heart,"
he assures her in the first sentence of his first letter. He feels them
already too much a part of himself to ever "try and find
fault,"&mdash;"nothing comes of it all,&mdash;so into me has it gone and
part of me has it become, this great living poetry of yours, not a
flower of which but took root and grew." It was "living," like his own;
it was also direct, as his own was not. His frank <i>cameraderie</i> was
touched from the outset with a fervent, wondering admiration to which he
was by no means prone. "You <i>do</i>, what I always wanted, hoped to
do, and only seem likely now to do for the first time. You speak out,
<i>you</i>,&mdash;I only make men and women speak&mdash;give you truth
broken into prismatic hues, and fear the pure white light, even if it is
in me, <i>but I am going to try</i>." Thus the first contact with the
"Lyric Love" of after days set vibrating the chords of all that was
lyric and personal in Browning's nature. His <a name="page79"
id="page79">brilliant</a> virtuosity in the personation of other minds
threatened to check all simple utterance of his own. The "First Poem" of
Robert Browning had yet to be written, but now, as soon as he had broken
from his "dancing ring of men and women,"&mdash;the Dramatic Lyrics and
Romances and one or two outstanding dramas,&mdash;he meant to write it.
Miss Barrett herself hardly understood until much later the effect that
her personality, the very soul that spoke in her poetry, had upon her
correspondent. She revelled in the Dramatic Lyrics and Romances, and not
least in rollicking pieces, like <i>Sibrandus</i> or <i>The Spanish
Cloister</i>, which appealed to the robust masculine humour with which
this outwardly fragile woman is too rarely credited. <i>Pippa Passes</i>
she could find in her heart to covet the authorship of, more than any of
his other works&mdash;a preference in which he agreed. Few more brilliant
appreciations of English poetry are extant than some of those which sped
during 1845 and 1846 from the invalid chamber in Harley Street to the
"old room" looking out on the garden at New Cross. But she did not
conceal from him that she wished him to seek "the other crown" also. "I
do not think, with all that music in you, only your own personality
should be dumb."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref28" id="fnref28"
href="#fn28">[28]</a></span> But she undoubtedly, with all her sense of
the glory of the dramatic art, discouraged his writing for the stage, a
domain which she regarded with an animus curiously compounded of Puritan
loathing, poetic scorn, and <a name="page80" id="page80">wellbred</a>
shrinking from the vulgarity of the green-room. And it is clear that
before the last plays, <i>Luria</i> and <i>A Soul's Tragedy</i>, were
published his old stage ambition had entirely vanished. It was not
altogether hyperbole (in any case the hyperbole was wholly unconscious)
when he spoke of her as a new medium to which his sight was gradually
becoming adjusted, "<i>seeing all things, as it does, in you.</i>"</p>

<p>She, on her part, united, as clever women in love so often do, with a
woman's more utter self-abasement a larger measure of critical
penetration. The "poor tired wandering singer," who so humbly took the
hand of the liberal and princely giver, and who with perfect sincerity
applied to herself his unconscious phrase&mdash;</p>

class="fnref"><a name="fnref29" id="fnref29"
href="#fn29">[29]</a></span>&mdash;shows at the same time the keenest
insight into the qualities of his work. She felt in him the masculine
temper and the masculine range, his singular union of rough and even
burly power with subtle intellect and penetrating music. With the world
of society and affairs she had other channels of communication. But no
one of her other friends&mdash;not <i>Orion</i> Horne, not even
Kenyon&mdash;bridged as Browning did the gulf between the world of
society and affairs, which she vaguely knew, and the romantic world of
poetry in which she lived. If she quickened the <a name="page81"
id="page81">need</a> for lyrical utterance in him, he drew her, in his
turn, into a closer and richer contact with common things. If she had
her part in <i>Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day</i>, he had his, no less, in
<i>Aurora Leigh</i>.</p>

<p>Twenty-one months passed between Browning's first letter and their
marriage. The tentative exchange of letters passed into a formal
"contract" to correspond,&mdash;sudden if not as "unadvised" as the
love-vows of Juliet, a parallel which he shyly hinted, and she, with the
security of the whole-hearted, boldly recalled. All the winter and early
spring her health forbade a meeting, and it is clear that but for the
quiet pressure of his will they never would have met. But with May came
renewed vigour, and she reluctantly consented to a visit. "He has a way
of putting things which I have not, a way of putting aside,&mdash;so he
came." A few weeks later he spoke. She at first absolutely refused to
entertain the thought; he believed, and was silent. But in the meantime
the letters and the visits "rained down more and more," and the fire
glowed under the surface of the writing and the talk, subdued but
unsuppressed. Once more his power of "putting aside" compelled her to
listen, and when she listened she found herself assailed at a point
which her own exalted spirituality made her least able to defend, by a
love more utterly self-sacrificing than even she had ever imagined. This
man of the masterful will, who took no refusals, might perhaps in any
case have finally "put aside" all obstacles to her consent. But when
<a name="page82" id="page82">he</a> disclosed&mdash;to her amazement,
well as she thought she knew him&mdash;that he had asked the right to
love her without claiming any love in return, that when he first spoke
he had believed her disease to be incurable, and yet preferred to be
allowed to sit only a day at her side to the fulfilment of "the
brightest dream which should exclude her," her resistance gave
way,&mdash;and little by little, in her own beautiful words,
she was drawn into the persuasion that something was left, and that she
could still do something for the happiness of another. In another sense
than she intended in the great opening sonnet "from the Portuguese,"
Love, undreamt of, had come to her with the irresistible might of Death,
and called her back into life by rekindling in her the languishing,
almost extinguished, desire to live. Is it hyperbole, to be reminded of
that other world-famous rescue from death which Browning, twenty-five
years later, was to tell with such infinite verve? Browning did not need
to imagine, but only to remember, the magnificent and audacious vitality
of his Herakles; he had brought back his own "espoused saint," like
Alcestis, from the grave.</p>

<p>But the life thus gained was, in the immediate future, full of
problems. Browning, said Kenyon, was "great in everything"; and during
the year which followed their engagement he had occasion to exhibit the
capacities both of the financier he had once declined to be, and of the
diplomatist he was willing to become. Love <a name="page83"
id="page83">had</a> flung upon his life, as upon hers, a sudden
splendour for which he was in no way prepared. "My whole scheme of
life," he wrote to her,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref30"
id="fnref30" href="#fn30">[30]</a></span> "(with its wants, material
wants at least, closely cut down), was long ago calculated&mdash;and it
supposed <i>you</i>, the finding such an one as you, utterly
impossible." But his schemes for a profession and an income were
summarily cut short. Elizabeth Barrett peremptorily declined to
countenance any such sacrifice of the work he was called to for any
other. The same deep sense of what was due to him, and to his wife,
sustained her through the trial that remained,&mdash;from the apparent
degradation of secrecy and subterfuge which the domestic policy of Mr
Barrett made inevitable, to the mere physical and nervous strain of
rising, that September morning of 1846, from an invalid's couch to be
married. That "peculiarity," as she gently termed it, of her father's,
malign and cruel as it was, twice precipitated a happy crisis in their
fortunes, which prudence might have postponed. His refusal to allow her
to seek health in Italy in Oct. 1845 had brought them definitely
together; his second refusal in Aug. 1846 drove her to the one
alternative of going there as Browning's wife. A week after the marriage
ceremony, during which they never met, Mrs Browning left her home, with
the faithful Wilson and the indispensable Flush, <i>en route</i> for
Southampton. The following day they arrived in Paris.</p>

<a name="page84" id="page84"></a>
<h3>II.</h3>

<p>There followed fifteen years during which the inexhaustible
correspondents of the last twenty months exchanged no further letter,
for they were never parted. That is the sufficient outward symbol of
their all but flawless union. After a leisurely journey through France,
and an experimental sojourn at the goal of Mrs Browning's two frustrated
journeys, Pisa, they settled towards the close of April 1847 in
furnished apartments in Florence, moving some four months later into the
more permanent home which their presence was to render famous, the
Palazzo (or "Casa") Guidi, just off the Piazza Pitti.</p>

<p>Their life&mdash;mirrored for us in Mrs Browning's vivid and
delightful letters&mdash;was, like many others, in which we recognise
rare and precious quality, singularly wanting in obviously expressive
traits. It is possible to describe everything that went on in the
Browning household in terms applicable to those of scores of other
persons of wide interests, cultivated tastes, and moderate but not
painfully restricted means. All that was passionate, ideal, heroic in
them found expression through conditions which it needs a fine eye to
distinguish from those of easy-going bourgeois mediocrity. Their large
and catholic humanity exempted them from much that makes for bold and
sensational outline in the story of a career. Their poetic home was
built upon all the philistine virtues. Mrs Jameson laughed at their
<a name="page85" id="page85">"miraculous</a> prudence
and economy"; and Mrs Browning herself laughed, a little, at her
husband's punctilious rigour in paying his debts,&mdash;his "horror of
owing five shillings for five days"; Browning, a born virtuoso in
whatever he undertook, abhorring a neglected bill as he did an easy
rhyme, and all other symbols of that slovenly Bohemia which came
nearest, on the whole, to his conception of absolute evil. They lived at
first in much seclusion, seeking no society, and unknown alike to the
Italian and the English quarters of the Florentine world. But Arcady
was, at bottom, just as foreign to their ways as Bohemia. "Soundless and
stirless hermits," Mrs Browning playfully called them; but in no house in
Florence did the news of political and literary Europe find keener
comment or response than in this quiet hermitage. Two long absences,
moreover (1851-52 and 1855-56), divided between London and Paris,
interrupted their Italian sojourn; and these times were crowded with
friendly intercourse, which they keenly enjoyed. "No place like Paris
for living in," Browning declared after returning from its blaze to the
quiet retreat of Casa Guidi. But both felt no less deeply the charm of
their "dream life" within these old tapestried
walls.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref31" id="fnref31"
href="#fn31">[31]</a></span> Nor did either, in spite of their delight
in French poetry and their vivid interest in French politics, really
enter the French world. They were received by George Sand, whose
"indiscreet immortalities" had ravished Elizabeth Barrett in her invalid
<a name="page86" id="page86">chamber</a> years before; but though she
"felt the burning soul through all that quietness," and through the
"crowds of ill-bred men who adore her <i>à genoux bas</i>, betwixt a
puff of smoke and an ejection of saliva,"&mdash;they both felt that she
did not care for them. Dumas, another admiration, they did not see; an
introduction to Hugo, Browning carried about for years but had no chance
of presenting; Béranger they saw in the street, and regretted the absence
of an intermediator. Balzac, to their grief, was just dead. A complete
set of his works was one of their Florentine ambitions. One memorable
intimacy was formed, however, during the Paris winter of 1851-52; for it
was now that he first met Joseph Milsand, his warm friend until
Milsand's death in 1886, and probably, for the last twenty years at
least, the most beloved of all his friends, as he was at all times one
of his shrewdest yet kindliest critics. Their summer visits to London
(1851, 1852, 1855, 1856) brought them much more of intimate personal
converse, tempered, however, inevitably, in a yet greater proportion, by
pain, discomfort, and fatigue. Of himself, yet more than of the
Laureate, might have been used the phrase in which he was to dedicate a
later poem to Tennyson&mdash;"noble and sincere in friendship." The
visitors who gathered about him in these London visits included friends
who belonged to every phase and aspect of his career&mdash;from his old
master and mentor, Fox, and Kenyon, the first begetter of his wedded
happiness, to Dante Rossetti, his first and, for years to come,
<a name="page87" id="page87">solitary</a> disciple,
and William Allingham, whom Rossetti introduced. Among his own
contemporaries they were especially intimate with Tennyson,&mdash;the
sterling and masculine "Alfred" of Carlyle, whom the world first learnt
to know from his biography; and with Carlyle himself, a more genial and
kindly Carlyle than most others had the gift of evoking, and whom his
biographers mostly efface.</p>

</div>

<p>After their return from the second journey to the north their Italian
life lost much of its dream-like seclusion. The publication of <i>Men and
Women</i> (1855) and <i>Aurora Leigh</i> (1856) drew new visitors to the
salon in Casa Guidi, and after 1853 they repeatedly wintered in Rome,
mingling freely in its more cosmopolitan society, and, on occasion, in
the gaieties of the Carnival. To the end, however, their Roman circle was
more American than English. "Is Mr Browning an American?" asked an
English lady of the American ambassador. "Is it possible that you ask me
that?" came the prompt and crushing retort; "why, there is not a village
in the United States so small that they could not tell you that Robert
Browning is an Englishman, and they wish he were an American."
Spiritualism, in the main an American institution, became during the
later years a centre of fervid interest to the one and an irritant to
the other. One turns gladly from that episode to their noble and helpful
friendship for a magnificent old dying lion, with whom, as every one
else discovered, it was ill to play&mdash;Walter Savage Landor. Here it
was <a name="page88" id="page88">the</a> wife who looked on with
critical though kindly sarcasm at what she thought her husband's
generous excess of confidence. Of all these intimacies and
relationships, however, the poetry of these years discloses hardly a
glimpse. His actual dealings with men and women called out all his
genial energies of heart and brain, but&mdash;with one
momentous exception&mdash;they did not touch his imagination.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Almost as faint as these echoes of personal friendship are those of
the absorbing public interest of these years, the long agony, fitfully
relieved by spells of desperate and untimely hope, of the Italian
struggle for liberty. The Brownings arrived in Florence during the lull
which preceded the great outbreak of 1848. From the historic "windows of
Casa Guidi" they looked forth upon the gentle futilities of the Tuscan
revolution, the nine days' fight for Milan, the heroic adventure of
Savoy, and the apparently final collapse of all these high endeavours on
the field of Novara. Ten years of petty despotism on the one side, of "a
unanimity of despair" on the other, followed; and then the monotonous
tragedy seemed to break suddenly into romance, as the Emperor, "deep and
cold," marched his armies over the Alps for the Deliverance of Italy.</p>

<p>Of all this the Brownings were deeply moved spectators. Browning
shared his wife's sympathy with the <a name="page89"
id="page89">Italians</a> and her abhorrence of Austria, and it is not
likely that he uttered either sentiment with less vivacity and emphasis,
though much less of his talk is on record. "'How long, O Lord, how
long!' Robert kept saying." But he had not her passionate admiration for
France, still less her faith in the President-Emperor. His less lyric
temperament did not so readily harbour unqualified emotion as hers. His
judgment of character was cooler, and with all his proverbial readiness
as a poet to provide men of equivocal conduct with hypothetical
backgrounds of lofty or blameless motive, he was in practice as exempt
from amiable illusions as he was from narrow spite. Himself the most
exact and precise in his dealings with the world, he could pardon the
excesses and irregularities of a great nature; but sordid self-seeking
under the mask of high ideals revolted him. He laughed at the boyish
freaks of Lander's magnificent old age, which irritated even his
large-hearted wife; but he could not forgive Louis Napoleon the <i>coup
d'état</i>, and when the liberation of Lombardy was followed by the
annexation of Savoy and Nice, the Emperor's devoted defender had to
listen, without the power of effective retort, to his biting summary of
the situation: "It was a great action; but he has taken eighteenpence
for it, which is a pity."</p>

<p>A dozen years later Louis Napoleon's equivocal character and career
were to be subjected by Browning to a still more equivocal exposition.
But this sordid <a name="page90" id="page90">trait</a> brought him
within a category of "soul" upon which Browning did not yet, in these
glowing years, readily lavish his art. A poem upon Napoleon, which had
occupied him much during the winter of 1859 (cf. note, p.
<a href="#page167">167</a> below), was abandoned. "Blougram's" splendid
and genial duplicity already attracted him, but the analysis of the
meretricious figure of Napoleon became a congenial problem only to that
later Browning of the 'Sixties and 'Seventies who was to explore the
shady souls of a Guido, a Miranda, and a Sludge. On the other hand,
deeply as he felt the sorrows of Italy, it was no part of his poetic
mission to sing them. The voice of a great community wakened no lyric
note in him, nor did his anger on its behalf break into dithyrambs.
Nationality was not an effectual motive with him. He felt as keenly as
his wife, or as Shelley; but his feeling broke out in fitful allusion or
sardonic jest in the <i>De Gustibus</i> or the <i>Old
Pictures</i>&mdash;not in a <i>Casa Guidi Windows</i>, or <i>Songs
before Congress</i>, an <i>Ode to Naples</i>, or a <i>Hellas</i>. An
"Ode" containing, by his own account, fierce things about
England, he destroyed after Villafranca. It is only in subtle and
original variations that we faintly recognise the broad simple theme of
Italy's struggle for deliverance. The <i>Patriot</i> and <i>Instans
Tyrannus</i> both have a kind of nexus with the place and time; but the
one is a caustic satire on popular fickleness and the other a
sardonically humorous travesty of persecution. Italy is mentioned in
neither. <a name="page91" id="page91">Both</a> are far removed from the
vivid and sympathetic reflection of the national struggle which thrills
us in <i>The Italian in England</i> and the third scene of <i>Pippa
Passes</i>. This "tyrant" has nothing to do with the
Austrian whom Luigi was so eager to assassinate, or any other: whatever
in him belongs to history has been permeated through and through with
the poet's derisive irony; he is despotism stripped of the passionate
conviction which may lend it weight and political significance, reduced
to a kind of sport, like the chase of a butterfly, and contemplating its
own fantastic tricks with subdued amusement.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The great political drama enacted in Italy during the Brownings'
residence there, thus scarcely stirred the deeper currents of Browning's
imagination, any more than, for all the vivid and passionate eloquence
she poured forth in its name, it really touched the genius of his wife.
The spell of Italian scenery was less easily evaded than the
abstractions of politics by a poet of his keen sensibility to light and
colour. And the years of his Italian sojourn certainly left palpable
traces, not only, as is obvious, upon the landscape background which
glows behind his human figures, but on his way of conceiving and
rendering the whole relation between Nature and Man. They did not,
indeed, make him in any sense a Nature poet. In
<a name="page92" id="page92">that</a> very song of delight in "Italy, my
Italy," which tells how the things he best loves in the world are</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in4">"a castle precipice-encurled</span><br />
      In a gash of the wind-grieved Apennine,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or some old palazzo, with a pointed cypress to guard
it, by the opaque blue breadth of summer sea, the joy in mountain and
sea is subtly reinforced at every point by the play of human interest;
there are frescoes on the crumbling walls, and a barefooted girl tumbles
melons on the pavement with news that the king has been shot at; art and
politics asserting their place beside Nature in the heart of Italy's
"old lover." And in the actual life of the Brownings "Nature" had to be
content, as a rule, with the humbler share. Their chosen abode was not a
castle in the Apennines or an old crumbling house by the southern sea,
but an apartment commanding the crowded streets of Florence; and their
principal absences from it were spent in Rome, in London, or in the yet
more congenial "blaze of Paris." They delighted certainly to escape into
the forest uplands. "Robert and I go out and lose ourselves in the woods
and mountains, and sit by the waterfalls on the starry and moonlit
nights," she wrote from their high perch above Lucca in 1849; but their
adventures in this kind were on the whole like the noon-disport of the
amphibian swimmer in <i>Fifine</i>,&mdash;they always admitted of an
easy retreat to the <i>terra firma</i> of civilisation,&mdash;</p>

<a name="page93" id="page93"></a>
<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Land the solid and safe<br />
     <span class="in1">To welcome again (confess!)</span><br />
      When, high and dry, we chafe<br />
     <span class="in1">The body, and don the dress."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Nature Browning knew and loved was well within
sight of humanity, and it was commonly brought nearer by some intrusive
vestiges of man's work; the crescent moon drifting in the purple
twilight, or "lamping" between the cypresses, is seen over Fiesole or
Samminiato; the "Alpine gorge" above Lucca has its ruined chapel and its
mill; the Roman Campagna has its tombs&mdash;"Rome's ghost since her
decease"; the Etrurian hill&mdash;fastnesses have their crowning cities
"crowded with culture." He had always had an alert eye for the elements
of human suggestion in landscape. But his rendering of landscape before
the Italian period was habitually that of a brilliant, graphic, but not
deeply interested artist, wielding an incisive pencil and an opulent
brush, fastening upon every bit of individual detail, and sometimes, as
in the admirable <i>Englishman in Italy</i>, recalling Wordsworth's
indignant reproof of the great fellow-artist&mdash;Scott&mdash;who "made
an inventory of Nature's charms." This hard objective brilliance does
not altogether disappear from the work of his Italian period. But it
tends to give way to a strangely subtle interpenetration of the visible
scene with the passion of the seeing soul. Nature is not more alive, but
her life thrills and palpitates in subtler relation with the life of
man. The author of <i>Men and Women</i> is a greater poet
<a name="page94" id="page94">of</a> Nature than the author of the
<i>Lyrics and Romances</i>, because he is, also, a greater poet of
"Soul"; for his larger command of soul-life embraces just those moods of
spiritual passion which beget the irradiated and transfigured Nature for
which, since Wordsworth, poetry has continually striven to find
expression. Browning's subtler feeling for Nature sprang from his
profounder insight into love. Love was his way of approach, as it was
eminently not Wordsworth's, to the transfigured Nature which Wordsworth
first disclosed. It is habitually lovers who have these
visions,&mdash;all that was mystical in Browning's mind attaching
itself, in fact, in some way to his ideas of love. To the Two in the
Campagna its primeval silence grows instinct with passion, and its peace
with joy,&mdash;the joy of illimitable space and freedom, alluring yet
mocking the finite heart that yearns. To the lovers of the Alpine gorge
the old woods, heaped and dim, that hung over their troth-plighting,
mysteriously drew them together; the moment that broke down the bar
between soul and soul also breaking down, as it were, the bar between
man and nature:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"The forests had done it; there they stood;<br />
     <span class="in1">We caught for a moment the powers at play:</span><br />
      They had mingled us so, for once and good,<br />
     <span class="in1">Their work was done, we might go or stay,</span><br />
      They relapsed to their ancient mood."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such "moments" were, in fact, for Browning as well
as for his lovers, rare and fitful exceptions to the general
<a name="page95" id="page95">nonchalance</a> of Nature towards
human affairs. The powers did good, as they did evil, "at play";
intervening with a kind of cynical or ironical detachment (like Jaques
plighting Touchstone and Audrey) in an alien affair of hearts. A certain
eerie playfulness is indeed a recurring trait in Browning's highly
individual feeling about Nature; the uncanny playfulness of a wild
creature of boundless might only half intelligible to man, which man
contemplates with mingled joy, wonder, and fear. Joy, when the brown old
Earth wears her good gigantic smile, on an autumn morning; wonder, when
he watches the "miracles wrought in play" in the teeming life of the
Campagna; fear, when, on a hot August midnight, Earth tosses stormily on
her couch. And all these notes of feelings are struck, with an intensity
and a boldness of invention which make it unique among his writings, in
the great romantic legend of <i>Childe Roland</i>. What the <i>Ancient
Mariner</i> is in the poetry of the mysterious terrors and splendours of
the sea, that <i>Childe Roland</i> is in the poetry of bodeful horror,
of haunted desolation, of waste and plague, ragged distortion, and
rotting ugliness in landscape. The Childe, like the Mariner, advances
through an atmosphere and scenery of steadily gathering menace; the
"starved ignoble" Nature, "peevish and dejected" among her scrub of
thistle and dock, grows malignant; to the barren waste succeed the
spiteful little river with its drenched despairing willows, the
blood-trampled mire and wrecked torture-engine, the poisonous
<a name="page96" id="page96">herbage</a> and palsied oak, and
finally the mountains, ignoble as the plain&mdash;"mere ugly heights and
heaps," ranged round the deadly den of the Dark Tower. But Browning's
horror-world differs from Coleridge's in the pervading sense that the
powers which control its issues are "at play." The catastrophe is not
the less tragic for that; but the heroic knight is not a culprit who has
provoked the vengeance of his pursuers, but a quarry whose course they
follow with grim half-suppressed laughter as he speeds into the trap.
The hoary cripple cannot hide his malicious glee, the "stiff blind
horse" is as grotesque as he is woeful, the dreary day itself, as it
sinks, shoots one grim red leer at the doomed knight as he sets forth;
in the penury and inertness of the wasted plain he sees "grimace"; the
mountains fight like bulls or doze like dotards; and the Dark Tower
itself is "round and squat," built of brown stone, a mere anticlimax to
romance; while round it lie the sportsmen assembled to see the end&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay<br />
      Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay."</p>
</div>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>But the scenery of Italy, with all its appeals of picturesque outline
and glowing colour, interested Browning less than its painting,
sculpture, and music. "Nature I loved, and after Nature, Art," Landor
declared in one of his stately epitaphs on himself; Browning
<a name="page97" id="page97">would</a>, in this sense of the terms at
least, have inverted their order. Casa Guidi windows commanded a view,
not only of revolutionary throngs, but of the façade of the
Pitti&mdash;a fact of at least equal significance. From the
days of his boyish pilgrimages to the Dulwich Gallery across the
Camberwell meadows, he had been an eager student and critic of painting;
curious, too, if not yet expert in all the processes and technicalities
of the studio. He judged pictures with the eye of a skilful draughtsman;
and two rapid journeys had given him some knowledge of the Italian
galleries. Continuous residence among the chief glories of the brush and
chisel did not merely multiply artistic incitement and appeal; it
brought the whole world of art into more vital touch with his
imaginative activity. It would be hard to say that there is any definite
change in his view of art, but its problems grow more alluring to him,
and its images more readily waylay and capture his passing thought. The
artist as such becomes a more dominant figure in his hierarchy of
spiritual workers; while Browning himself betrays a new
self-consciousness of his own function as an artist in verse;
conceiving, for instance, his consummate address to his wife as an
artist's way of solving a perplexity which only an artist could feel,
that of finding unique expression for the unique love.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"He who works in fresco, steals a hair-brush,<br />
      Curbs the liberal hand, subservient proudly,<br />
      Cramps his spirit, crowds its all in little,<br />
      <a name="page98" id="page98"></a>
      Makes a strange art of an art familiar,<br />

      He who blows thro' bronze may breathe thro' silver,<br />
      Fitly serenade a slumbrous princess;<br />
      He who writes may write for once, as I do."</p>
</div>

<p>Browning is distinguished among the poets to whom art meant much by
the prominence with him of the specifically artist's point of view. He
cared for pictures, or for music, certainly, as clues to the
interpretation of human life, hints of "the absolute truth of things"
which the sensible world veils and the senses miss. But he cared for
them also, and yet more, as expressions of the artist's own "love of
loving, rage of knowing, seeing, feeling" that absolute truth. And he
cared for them also and not less, without regard to anything they
expressed, as simple outflows of vitality, however grotesque or
capricious. His own eye and ear continually provoked his hand to
artistic experiments and activities. During the last years in Italy his
passion for modelling even threatened to divert him from poetry; and his
wife playfully lamented that the "poor lost soul" produced only casts,
which he broke on completion, and no more Men and Women. And his own
taste in art drew him, notoriously, to work in which the striving hand
was palpable,&mdash;whether it was a triumphant <i>tour de force</i>
like Cellini's Perseus, in the Loggia&mdash;their daily banquet in the
early days at Florence; or the half-articulate utterances of "the
Tuscan's early art," like those "Pre-Giotto pictures" which
<a name="page99" id="page99">surrounded</a> them in the salon of
Casa Guidi, "quieting" them if they were over busy, as Mrs Browning
beautifully says,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref32" id="fnref32"
href="#fn32">[32]</a></span> more perhaps in her own spirit than in her
husband's.</p>

<i>Letters of E.B.B</i>., ii. 199.
</div>

<p>Almost all Browning's finest poems of painting belong to these Italian
years, and were enshrined in <i>Men and Women.</i> They all illustrate
more or less his characteristic preoccupation with the artist's point of
view, and also, what is new, the point of view of particular and
historical artists,&mdash;a Guercino, an Andrea del Sarto, a Giotto, a
Lippo Lippi. Even where he seems to write under the peculiar spell of his
wife, as in the <i>Guardian Angel,</i> this trait asserts itself. They
had spent three glowing August days of 1848 at Fano, and thrice visited
the painting by Guercino there,&mdash;"to drink its beauty to our soul's
content." Mrs Browning wrote of the "divine" picture. Browning entered,
with a sympathy perhaps the more intimate that his own "angel" was with
him, and the memory of an old friend peculiarly near, into sympathy with
the guardian angel; but with one of his abrupt turns he passes into the
world of the studio, telling us how he has written for the sake of "dear
Guercino's fame," because he "did not work thus earnestly at all times,
and has endured some wrong." With all this, however, the <i>Guardian
Angel</i> is one of the few pieces left by Browning which do not
instantly discover themselves as his. His typical children are
well-springs of spiritual influence, <a name="page100"
id="page100">scattering</a> the aerial dew of quickening song upon a
withered world, or taking God's ear with their "little human praise."
The spirituality of this child is of a different temper,&mdash;the
submissive "lamblike" temper which is fulfilled in quiescence and
disturbed by thought.</p>

<p>What is here a mere flash of good-natured championship becomes in the
great monologue of <i>Andrea del Sarto</i> an illuminating compassion.
Compassion, be it noted, far less for the husband of an unfaithful wife
than for the great painter whose genius was tethered to a soulless mate.
The situation appealed profoundly to Browning, and Andrea's monologue is
one of his most consummate pieces of dramatic characterisation. It is a
study of spiritual paralysis, achieved without the least resort to the
rhetorical conventions which permit poetry to express men's silence with
speech and their apathy with song. Tennyson's Lotos-eaters chant their
world-weariness in choral strains of almost too magnificent afflatus to
be dramatically proper on the lips of spirits so resigned. Andrea's
spiritual lotus-eating has paralysed the nerve of passion in him, and
made him impotent to utter the lyrical cry which his fate seems to
crave. He is half "incapable of his own distress"; his strongest
emotions are a flitting hope or a momentary pang, quickly dissolved into
the ground-tone of mournful yet serene contemplation, which seems to
float ghostlike in the void between grief and joy. Reproach turns to
<a name="page101" id="page101">grateful</a> acquiescence on his lips;
the sting of blighted genius is instantly annulled by the momentary
enchantment of her smile, whose worth he knows too well and remembers
too soon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in7">"And you smile indeed!</span><br />
      This hour has been an hour! Another smile?<br />
      If you would sit thus by me every night<br />
      I should work better, do you comprehend?<br />
      I mean that I should earn more, give you more."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The tragedy is for us, not for him: he regrets
little, and would change still less. The "silver-grey" lights of dreamy
autumn eve were never with more delicate insight rendered in terms of
soul.</p>

<p>Suddenly these autumnal half-tones give way to the flash of torches in
the fragrant darkness of an Italian night. There is a scurry of feet
along a dark alley, a scuffle at the end, and the genial rotundity of
Brother Lippo Lippi's face, impudent, brilliant, insuppressible, leers
into the torchlight. <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i> is not less true and
vivacious than the <i>Andrea</i>, if less striking as an example of
Browning's dramatic power. Sarto is a great poetic creation; Browning's
own robust temperament provided hardly any aid in delineating the
emaciated soul whose gifts had thinned down to a morbid perfection of
technique. But this vigorous human creature, with the teeming brain, and
the realist eye, and the incorrigible ineptitude for the restraints of
an insincere clerical or other idealism, was a being to which Browning's
heart went out; <a name="page102" id="page102">and</a> he even makes him
the mouthpiece of literary ideas, which his own portrait as here drawn
aptly exemplifies. There is not much "soul" in Lippo, but he has the
hearty grasp of common things, of the world in its business and its
labour and its sport and its joys, which "edifies" men more than
artificial idealities designed expressly to "beat nature."
He "lends his mind out" and finds the answering mind in other men
instead of imposing one from without:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in5">"This world's no blot for us,</span><br />
      Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:<br />
      To find its meaning is my meat and drink."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">"Ay, but," objects the Prior, "you do not instigate
to prayer!" And it is the prior and his system which for Lippi stand in
the place of Andrea's soulless wife. Lucrezia's illusive beauty lured
his soul to its doom; and Lippo, forced, as a child of eight, to
renounce the world and put on the cassock he habitually disgraced,
triumphantly cast off the incubus of a sham spirituality which only
tended to obscure what was most spiritual in himself. He was fortunate
in the poet who has drawn his portrait so superbly in his sitter's own
style.</p>

<p>These two monologues belong to the most finished achievements of
Browning. But we should miss much of the peculiar quality of his mind,
as well as a vivid glimpse into the hope-and-fear-laden atmosphere of
Tuscany in the early 'Fifties, if we had not that quaint heterogeneous
causerie called <i>Old Pictures in Florence</i>. There is passion in its
grotesqueness and <a name="page103" id="page103">method</a> in its
incoherence; for the old painters, whose apologies he is ostensibly
writing, with their imperfect achievement and their insuppressible
idealism, sounded a congenial note to men whose eyes were bent
incessantly upon the horizon waiting for the invisible to come into
play, and Florence looked for her completion as Giotto's unfinished
campanile for its spire.</p>

<p>If Italy deepened Browning's hold upon the problems of painting, it
witnessed the beginnings of his equally characteristic achievement in
the kindred poetry of music. Not that his Italian life can have brought
any notable access of musical impressions to a man who had grown up
within easy reach of London concerts and operas. But England was a land
in which music was performed; Italy was a land in which it was made.
Verdi's "worst opera" could be heard in many places; but in Florence the
knowing spectator might see Verdi himself, at its close,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Look through all the roaring and the wreaths<br />
      Where sits Rossini patient in his stall."</p>
</div>

<p>Italian music, with its facile melody and its relative poverty of
ideas, could not find so full a response in Browning's nature as Italian
painting. It had had its own gracious and tender youth; and Palestrina,
whom he contrasts with the mountainous fuguists of "Saxe-Gotha" and
elsewhere, probably had for him the same kind of charm as the early
painters of Florence. Out of that "infancy," however, there had arisen
no "titanically infantine" Michelangelo, but a race of accomplished
<a name="page104" id="page104"><i>petits ma&icirc;tres</i></a>, whose
characteristic achievement was the opera of the rococo age. A Goldsmith
or a Sterne can make the light songs of their contemporaries eloquent
even to us of gracious amenities and cultivated charm; but Browning,
with the eternal April in his heart and brain, heard in the stately
measures it danced to, only the eloquence of a dirge, penetrated with
the sense of the mortality of such joy as theirs. Byron had sung gaily
of the gaieties of Venice; but the vivacious swing of <i>Beppo</i> was
less to Browning's mind than the "cold music" of Baldassare Galuppi, who
made his world dance to the strains of its own requiem, and fall upon
dreamy suggestions of decay in the very climax of the feast:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"What? Those lesser thirds so plaintive, sixths
     diminished,<br />
     <span class="in2">sigh on sigh,</span><br />
     Told them something? Those suspensions, those solutions<br />
     <span class="in2">&mdash;'Must we die?'</span><br />
     Those commiserating sevenths&mdash;"Life might last! We can<br />
     <span class="in2">but try!"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The musician himself has no such illusions; but his
music is only a more bitter echo:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Dust and ashes, dead and done with, Venice spent
     what<br />
     <span class="in2">Venice earned:</span><br />
     The soul, doubtless, is immortal&mdash;where a soul can be<br />
     <span class="in2">discerned."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And so the poet, in the self-consciousness of his
immense vitality, sweeps into the limbo of oblivion these dusty
<i>débris</i> of the past, with no nearer approach to the romantic
regret of a Malory for the glories of <a name="page105"
id="page105">old</a> time or to Villon's awestruck contemplation of the
mysterious evanishment of storied beauty, than the half-contemptuous
echo&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"'Dust and ashes!' So you creak it, and I want the
     heart<br />

     <span class="in2">all the gold</span><br />
     Used to hang and brush their bosoms? I feel chilly and<br />
     <span class="in2">grown old."</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the other music-poem of the Italian time it is not difficult to
detect a kindred mood beneath the half-disguise of rollicking rhymes and
whimsical comparisons. Once more Browning seems preoccupied with that in
music which lends expression to a soulless animation, a futile and
aimless vivacity. Only here it is the vivacity of the schools, not of
the ballroom. Yet some lines seem a very echo of that hollow joyless
mirth, for ever revolving on itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Est fuga, volvitur rota;<br />
      On we drift: where looms the dim port?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The intertwining and conflicting melodies of the
fugue echo the impotent strife of jangling tongues, "affirming, denying,
holding, risposting, subjoining,"&mdash;the shuttle play of comment and
gloze shrouding the light of nature and truth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Over our heads truth and nature&mdash;<br />
     <span class="in1">Still our life's zigzags and dodges,</span><br />
     Ins and outs, weaving a new legislature&mdash;<br />
     <span class="in1">God's gold just shining its last where that
     lodges,</span><br />
     Palled beneath man's usurpature."</p>
</div>

<a name="page106" id="page106"></a>
<p class="noindent">But Browning was at heart too alive to the charm of
this shuttle-play, of these zigzags and dodges,&mdash;of zigzags and
dodges of every kind,&mdash;not to feel the irony of the attack upon
this "stringing of Nature through cobwebs"; when the organist breaks
out, as the fugue's intricacy grows, "But where's music, the dickens?"
we hear Browning mocking the indignant inquiries of similar purport so
often raised by his readers. <i>Master Hugues</i> could only have been
written by one who, with a childlike purity of vision for truth and
nature, for the shining of "God's gold" and the glimpses of the "earnest
eye of heaven," had also a keen perception and instinctive delight in
every filament of the web of human "legislature."</p>

<p>This double aspect of Browning's poetic nature is vividly reflected in
the memorable essay on Shelley which he wrote at Paris in 1851, as an
introduction to a series of letters since shown to have been forged. The
essay&mdash;unfortunately not included in his Works&mdash;is a document
of first-rate importance for the mind of Browning in the midst of his
greatest time; it is also by far the finest appreciation of Shelley
which had yet appeared. He saw in Shelley one who, visionary and
subjective as he was, had solved the problem which confronts every
idealist who seeks to grasp the visible world in its concrete actuality.
To Browning himself that problem presented itself in a form which tasked
far more severely the resources of poetic imagination, in proportion as
actuality bodied itself forth to his alert <a name="page107"
id="page107">senses</a> in more despotic grossness and strength. Shelley
is commonly thought to have evaded this task altogether,&mdash;building
his dream-world of cloud and cavern loveliness remote from anything we
know. It is Browning, the most "actual" of poets, who insisted, half a
century ago, on the "practicality" of Shelley,&mdash;insisted, as it is
even now not superfluous to insist, on the fearless and direct energy
with which he strove to root his intuitions in experience. "His noblest
and predominating characteristic," he urges, to quote these significant
words once more, "is his simultaneous perception of Power and Love in
the absolute, and of Beauty and Good in the concrete, while he throws,
from his poet's station between both, swifter, subtler, and more
numerous films for the connection of each with each than have been
thrown by any modern artificer of whom I have knowledge; proving how, as
he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"'The spirit of the worm beneath the sod<br />
      In love and worship blends itself with God.'"</p>
</div>

<p>Browning has nowhere else expounded so fully his ideas about the aims
of his own art. It lay in the peculiar "dramatic" quality of his mind to
express himself freely only in situations not his own. Hence, while he
does not altogether avoid the poet as a character, his poets are drawn
with a curious externality and detachment. It is in his musicians, his
painters, his grammarians, that the heart and passion of Browning the
poet really live. He is the poet of musicians and of painters, the poet
of lawyers and physicians and Rabbis, <a name="page108"
id="page108">and</a> of scores of callings which never had a poet
before; but he is not the poets' poet. In the <i>Transcendentalism</i>,
however, after tilting with gay irony at the fault of over-much argument
in poetry, which the world ascribed to his own, he fixes in a splendid
image the magic which it fitfully yet consummately illustrates. The
reading public which entertained any opinion about him at all was
inclined to take him for another Boehme, "with a tougher book and
subtler meanings of what roses say." A few knew that they had to deal,
not less, with a "stout Mage like him of Halberstadt," who</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in1">"with a 'look you' vents a brace of rhymes,</span><br />
      And in there breaks the sudden rose herself,<br />
      Over us, under, round us every side."</p>
</div>

<p>The portrait of the poet of Valladolid, on the other hand (<i>How it
Strikes a Contemporary</i>), is not so much a study of a poet as of
popular misconception and obtuseness. A grotesquely idle legend of the
habits of the "Corregidor" flourishes among the good folks of
Valladolid; the speaker himself, who desires to do him justice, is a
plain, shrewd, but unimaginative observer ("I never wrote a line of
verse, did you?"), and makes us acquainted with everything but the inner
nature of the man. We see the corregidor in the streets, in his chamber,
at his frugal supper and "decent cribbage" with his maid, but never at
his verse. We see the alert objective eye of this man with the
"scrutinizing hat," who</p>

<a name="page109" id="page109"></a>
<div class="poem">
      <p>"stood and watched the cobbler at his trade, ...<br />
      If any beat a horse, you felt he saw,<br />
      If any cursed a woman, he took note,"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and all this, for Browning, went to the making of
the poet, but we get no inkling of the process itself. Browning had, in
his obscure as in his famous days, peculiar opportunities of measuring
the perversities of popular repute. Later on, in the heyday of his
renown, he chaffed its critical dispensers in his most uproarious vein
in <i>Pacchiarotto</i>. The <i>Popularity</i> stanzas present us with a
theory of it conveyed in that familiar manner of mingled poetry and
grotesqueness which was one of the obstacles to his own.</p>

<p>There is, however, among these fifty men and women one true and
sublime poet,&mdash;the dying "Grammarian," who applies the alchemy of a
lofty imagination to the dry business of verbal erudition.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"He said, 'What's time? Leave Now for dogs and
     apes!<br />
     <span class="in4">Man has Forever.'"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is one of the half-dozen lyrics which enshrine
in noble and absolutely individual form the central core of Browning's
passion and thought. Even the verse, with its sequence of smooth-flowing
iambics broken by the leap of the dactyl, and the difficult double rhyme,
sustains the mood of victorious but not lightly won serenity of
soul&mdash;"too full for sound and foam." It is, among songs over the
dead, what <i>Rabbi ben Ezra</i> and <i>Prospice</i> are among the songs
which face and grapple with death; the fittest requiem to follow such
deaths as <a name="page110" id="page110">those.</a> Like Ben Ezra, the
Grammarian "trusts death," and stakes his life on the trust:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"He ventured neck or nothing&mdash;heaven's
     success<br />
     <span class="in4">Found, or earth's failure:</span><br />
     'Wilt thou trust death or not?' He answered, 'Yes:<br />
     <span class="in4">Hence with life's pale lure!'"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To ordinary eyes he spends his days grovelling among
the dust and dregs of erudition; but it is the grovelling of a builder
at work upon a fabric so colossally planned that life is fitly spent in
laying the foundations. He was made in the large mould of the
gods,&mdash;born with "thy face and throat, Lyric Apollo,"&mdash;and the
disease which crippled and silenced him in middle life could only alter
the tasks on which he wreaked his mind. And now that he is dead, he
passes, as by right, to the fellowship of the universe&mdash;of the
sublime things of nature.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Here&mdash;here's his place, where meteors shoot,

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p><i>The Grammarian's Funeral</i> achieves, in the terms and with the
resources of Browning's art, the problem of which he saw the consummate
master in Shelley,&mdash;that <a name="page111" id="page111">of</a>
throwing "films" for the connexion of Power and Love in the abstract
with Beauty and Good in the concrete, and finding a link
between the lowliest service or worship and the spirit of God. Such a
conception of a poet's crowning glory implied a peculiarly close
relation in Browning's view between poetry and religion, and in
particular with the religion which, above all others, glorified the
lowly. Here lay, in short, the supreme worth for him of the Christian
idea. "The revelation of God in Christ" was for him the consummate
example of that union of divine love with the world&mdash;"through all
the web of Being blindly wove"&mdash;which Shelley had contemplated in
the radiant glow of his poetry; accepted by the reason, as he wrote a few
years later, it solved "all problems in the earth and out of it." To
that solution Shelley seemed to Browning to be on the way, and his
incomplete grasp of it appealed to him more powerfully than did the
elaborate dogmatisms professedly based upon it. Shelley had mistaken
"Churchdom" for Christianity; but he was on the way, Browning was
convinced, to become a Christian himself. "I shall say what I
think,&mdash;had Shelley lived he would have finally ranged himself with
the Christians."</p>

<p>This emphatic declaration is of great importance for Browning's
intellectual history. He may have overlooked the immense barriers which
must have always divided Shelley from the Christian world of his time;
he may have overlooked also that the Christian thought <a name="page112"
id="page112">of</a> our time has in some important points "ranged itself
with" Shelley; so that the Christianity which he might finally have
adopted would have been sufficiently unlike that which he assailed. But
it is clear that for Browning himself the essence of Christianity lay at
this time in something not very remote from what he revered as the
essence of Shelleyism&mdash;a corollary, as it were, ultimately implicit
in his thought.</p>

<p>It was thus a deeper poetical rather than a religious or doctrinal
interest which drew Browning in these Italian years, again and again to
seek his revealing experiences of souls amid the eddies and convulsions,
the exultations and the agonies, brought into the world by the amazing
"revelation of God in Christ." It is true that we nowhere approach this
focus of interest, that we have no glimpse, through Browning's art, how
that "revelation" shaped itself in the first disciples, far less of
Christ himself. But that was at no time Browning's way of bringing to
expression what he deeply cared for. He would not trumpet forth truth in
his own person, or blazon it through the lips of the highest recognised
authority; he let it struggle up through the baffling density, or
glimmer through the conflicting persuasions of alien minds, and break
out in cries of angry wonder or involuntary recognition. And nowhere is
this method carried further than in the Christian poems of the Italian
time. The supreme musicians and painters he avoids, but Fra Lippo Lippi
<a name="page113" id="page113">and</a> Master Hugues belong at least to
the crafts whose secrets they expound; while the Christian idea is set
in a borrowed light caught from the souls of men outside the Christian
world&mdash;an Arab physician, a Greek poet, a Jewish shepherd or rabbi,
or from Christians yet farther from the centre than these, like Blougram
and the Abbe Deodaet. In method as in conception these pieces are among
the most Browningesque things that Browning ever wrote. It is clear,
however, that while his way of handling these topics is absolutely his
own, his peculiar concern with them is new. The <i>Karshish</i>, the
<i>Clean</i>, and the <i>Blougram</i> have no prototype or parallel
among the poems of Browning's previous periods. In the early Dramatic
Lyrics and Romances, and in the plays, there is exquisite rendering of
religion, and also of irreligion; but the religion is just the simple
faith of Pippa or of Theocrite that "God's in his world"; and the
irreligion is the Humanist paganism of St Praxed's, not so much hostile
to Christianity as unconscious of it. No single poem written before 1850
shows that acute interest in the problems of Christian faith which
constantly emerges in the work of this and the following years.
<i>Saul</i>, which might be regarded as signally refuting this view,
strikingly confirms it; the David of the first nine sections, which
alone were produced in 1845, being the naïve, devout child, brother of
Pippa and of Theocrite; the evolution of this harping shepherd-boy into
the illuminated prophet of Christ <a name="page114" id="page114">was</a>
the splendid achievement of the later years.<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref33" id="fnref33" href="#fn33">[33]</a></span> And to all this
more acutely Christian work the <i>Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day</i>
(1850) served as a significant prologue.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn33" id="fn33" href="#fnref33">[33]</a></span>
It is, indeed, clear, as has been seen, from Browning's
correspondence that a sequel of this kind was intended when the first
nine sections were published. The traditional legend of David would in
any case suggest so much. That the intention was not then executed is
just the significant fact.
</div>

<p>There can be little doubt that the devout Christian faith of his wife
was principally concerned in this new direction of his poetry. Yet we
may easily overstate both the nature of her influence and its extent.
She, as little as he, was a dogmatic Christian; both refused to put on,
in her phrase, "any of the liveries of the sects."<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref34" id="fnref34" href="#fn34">[34]</a></span>
"The truth, as God sees it, must be something so different from these
opinions about truth.... I believe in what is divine and floats at
highest, in all these different theologies,&mdash;and because the really
Divine draws together souls, and tends so to a unity, could pray
anywhere and with all sorts of worshippers, from the Sistine chapel to
Mr Fox's, those kneeling and those standing."<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref35" id="fnref35" href="#fn35">[35]</a></span>
Yet she demurs, a little farther on in the same letter, to both these
extremes. "The Unitarians seem to me to throw over what is most
beautiful in the Christian Doctrine; but the Formulists, on the other
side, stir up a dust, in which it appears excusable not to see." To
which he replies (Aug. 17): "Dearest, I know your very meaning, in what
you said of religion, <a name="page115" id="page115">and</a> responded
to it with my whole soul&mdash;what you express now is for us both,
... those are my own feelings, my convictions beside&mdash;instinct
confirmed by reason."</p>

<p>These words of Browning's seem to furnish the clue to the relation
between their minds in this matter. Their intercourse disturbed no
conviction on either side, for their convictions were identical. But her
intense personal devoutness undoubtedly quickened what was personal in
his belief, drew it into an atmosphere of keener and more emotional
consciousness, and in particular gave to that "revelation of God in
Christ" which they both regarded as what was "most beautiful in the
Christian doctrine," a more vital hold upon his intellectual and
imaginative life. In this sense, but only in this sense, his fervid
words to her (February 1846)&mdash;"I mean to ... let my mind get used
to its new medium of sight, seeing all things as it does through you;
and then let all I have done be the prelude and the real work
begin"&mdash;were not unfulfilled. No deep hiatus, such as this phrase
suggests, divides the later, as a whole, from the earlier work: the
"dramatic" method, which was among the elements of his art most foreign
to her lyric nature, established itself more and more firmly in his
practice. But the letters of 1845-46 show that her example was
stimulating him to attempt a more direct and personal utterance in
poetry, and while he did not succeed, or succeeded only "once and for
one only," in evading his dramatic bias, he certainly
<a name="page116" id="page116">succeeded</a> in making the dramatic
form more eloquently expressive of his personal faith.</p>

<p>This was peculiarly the case in the remarkable <i>Christmas-Eve and
Easter-Day</i> (1850), the first-fruits of his married life, and the most
instinct of all his poems with the mingled literary and religious
influences which it brought. The influence of the ardent singer, which
impelled him to fuller self-expression, here concurred with that of the
devout but undogmatic Christian, which drew the problem of Christianity
nearer to the focus of his imagination and his thought. There is much
throughout which suggests that Browning was deliberately putting off the
habits and usages of his art, and reaching out this way and that towards
untried sources and avenues of expression. He lays hold for the first
time of the machinery of supernatural vision. Nothing that he had yet
done approached in boldness these Christmas and Easter apparitions of
the Lord of Love. They break in, unheralded, a startling but splendid
anomaly, upon his human and actual world. And the really notable thing
is that never had he drawn human actuality with so remorseless and even
brutal fidelity as just here. He seeks no legendary scene and atmosphere
like that of Theocrite's Rome, in which the angels who come and go, and
God who enjoys his "little human praise," would be missed if they were
not there; but opens the visions of the Empyrean upon modern Camberwell.
The pages in which Browning might seem, for once, to vie with the author
of the Apocalypse <a name="page117" id="page117">are</a> interleaved
with others in which, for once, he seems to vie with Balzac or Zola. Of
course this is intensely characteristic of Browning. The quickened
spiritual pulse which these poems betoken betrays itself just in his
more daringly assured embrace of the heights and the depths of the
universe, as communicating and akin, prompting also that not less daring
embrace of the extremes of expression,&mdash;sublime imagery and
rollicking rhymes,&mdash;as equally genuine utterances of spiritual
fervour,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"When frothy spume and frequent sputter<br />
      Prove that the soul's depths boil in earnest."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These lines, and the great Shelleyan declaration
that</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"A loving worm within its clod<br />
      Were diviner than a loveless God,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are the key to both poems, but peculiarly to the
<i>Christmas-Day,</i> in which they occur. We need not in any wise
identify Browning with the Christmas-Day visionary; but it is clear that
what is "dramatic" in him exfoliates, as it were, from a root of
character and thought which are altogether Browning's own. Browning is
apparent in the vivacious critic and satirist of religious
extravagances, standing a little aloof from all the constituted
religions; but he is apparent also in the imaginative and sympathetic
student of religion, who divines the informing spark of love in all
sincere worship; and however far he may have been from putting forward
the little conventicle with its ruins of humanity,
<a name="page118" id="page118">its</a> soul at struggle with insanity,
as his own final choice, that choice symbolised in a picturesque
half-humorous way his own profound preference for the spiritual good
which is hardly won. He makes the speaker choose the "earthen vessel" in
spite of its "taints of earth," because it brimmed with spiritual water;
but in Browning himself there was something which relished the spiritual
water the more because the earthen vessel was flawed.</p>

<p>Like <i>Christmas-Eve</i>, <i>Easter-Day</i> is a dramatic
study,&mdash;profound convictions of the poet's own being projected as
it were through forms of religious consciousness perceptibly more
angular and dogmatically defined than his own. The main speaker is
plainly not identical with the narrator of <i>Christmas-Eve,</i> who is
incidentally referred to as "our friend." Their first beliefs may be
much alike, but in the temper of their belief they differ widely. The
speaker in <i>Christmas-Eve</i> is a genial if caustic observer,
submitting with robust tolerance to the specks in the water which
quenches his thirst; the speaker of <i>Easter-Day</i> is an anxious
precisian, fearful of the contamination of earth, and hoping that he may
"yet escape" the doom of too facile content. The problem of the one is,
what to believe; the problem of the other, how to believe; and each is
helped towards a solution by a vision of divine love. But the Easter-Day
Vision conveys a sterner message than that of <i>Christmas-Eve</i>. Love
now illuminates, not by enlarging sympathy and disclosing the hidden
soul of good in <a name="page119" id="page119">error</a>, but by
suppressing sympathies too diffusely and expansively bestowed. The
Christmas Vision makes humanity seem more divine; the Easter Vision
makes the divine seem less human. The hypersensitive moral nature of the
Easter-Day speaker, on the other hand, sees his own criminal darkness of
heart and mind before all else, and the divine visitation becomes a Last
Judgment, with the fierce vindictive red of the Northern Lights
replacing the mild glory of the lunar rainbows, and a stern and scornful
cross-examination the silent swift convoy of the winged robe. This
difference of temper is vividly expressed in the style. The rollicking
rhymes, the "spume and sputter" of the fervent soul, give place to a
manner of sustained seriousness and lyric beauty.</p>

<p>Yet the Easter-Day speaker probes deeper and raises more fundamental
issues. When the form of Christian belief to be adopted has been
settled, a certain class of believing minds, not the least estimable,
will still remain restive. Browning of all men felt impatient of every
nominal belief held as unassimilated material, not welded into the
living substance of character; and he makes his Easter-Day visionary
confound with withering irony the "faith" which seeks assurance in
outward "evidence,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in7">"'Tis found,</span><br />
      No doubt: as is your sort of mind,<br />
      So is your sort of search: you'll find<br />
      What you desire."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Still less mercy has he for the dogmatic voluptuary
who <a name="page120" id="page120">complacently</a> assumes the
"all-stupendous tale" of Christianity to have been enacted</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in3">"to give our joys a zest,</span><br />
      And prove our sorrows for the best."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Upon these complacent materialisms and epicureanisms
of the religious character falls the scorching splendour of the Easter
Vision, with its ruthless condemnation of whatever is not glorified by
Love, passing over into the uplifting counter&mdash;affirmation,
indispensable to Browning's optimism, that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in2">"All thou dost enumerate</span><br />
      Of power and beauty in the world<br />
      The mightiness of Love was curled<br />
      Inextricably round about."</p>
</div>

<p>With all their nobility of feeling, and frequent splendour of
description, these twin poems cannot claim a place in Browning's work at
all corresponding to the seriousness with which he put them forward, and
the imposing imaginative apparatus called in. The strong personal
conviction which seems to have been striving for direct utterance,
checked without perfectly mastering his dramatic instincts and
habitudes, resulting in a beautiful but indecisive poetry which lacks
both the frankness of a personal deliverance and the plasticity of a
work of art. The speakers can neither be identified with the poet nor
detached from him; they are neither his mouthpieces nor his creations.
The daring supernaturalism seems to indicate that the old spell of
Dante, so keenly felt in the <i>Sordello</i> days, had been
<a name="page121" id="page121">wrought</a> to new
potency by the magic of the life in Dante's Florence, and the subtler
magic of the love which he was presently to compare not obscurely to
that of Dante for Beatrice.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref36"
id="fnref36" href="#fn36">[36]</a></span> The divine apparitions have
the ironic hauteurs and sarcasms of Beatrice in the <i>Paradise</i>. Yet
the comparison brings into glaring prominence the radical incoherence of
Browning's presentment. In Dante's world all the wonders that he
describes seem to be in place; but the Christmas and Easter Visions are
felt as intrusive anachronisms in modern London, where the divinest
influences are not those which become palpable in visions, but those
which work through heart and brain.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn36" id="fn36" href="#fnref36">[36]</a></span>
<i>One Word More</i>.
</div>

<p>Browning probably felt this, for the <i>Christmas-Eve and
Easter-Day</i> stands in this respect alone in his work. But the idea of
Christ as the sign and symbol of the love which penetrates the universe
lost none of its hold upon his imagination; and it inspired some of the
greatest achievements of the <i>Men and Women</i>. It was under this
impulse that he now, at some time during the early Italian years,
completed the splendid torso of <i>Saul</i>. David's Vision of the
Christ that is to be has as little apparent relation to the quiet
pastoralism of the earlier stanzas as the Easter Vision to the
common-sense reflections that preceded it. But while this Vision
abruptly bursts upon him, David's is the final conquest of his own
ardent intellect, under the impulse of a great human task which lifts it
beyond its experience, and <a name="page122" id="page122">calls</a> out
all its powers. David is occupied with no speculative question, but with
the practical problem of saving a ruined soul; and neither logical
ingenuity nor divine suggestion, but the inherent spiritual significance
of the situation, urges his thought along the lonely path of prophecy.
The love for the old king, which prompts him to try all the hidden paths
of his soul in quest of healing, becomes a lighted torch by which he
tracks out the meaning of the world and the still unrevealed purposes of
God; until the energy of thought culminates in vision, and the Christ
stands full before his eyes. All that is supernatural in the <i>Saul</i>
is viewed through the fervid atmosphere of David's soul. The magic of the
wonderful Nocturne at the close, where he feels his way home through the
appalled and serried gloom, is broken by no apparition; the whole earth
is alive and awake around him, and thrills to the quickening inrush of
the "new land"; but its light is the tingling emotion of the stars, and
its voice the cry of the little brooks; and the thronging cohorts of
angels and powers are unuttered and unseen.</p>

<p>Only less beautiful than Browning's pictures of spiritual childhood
are his pictures of spiritual maturity and old age. The lyric simplicity,
the naïve intensity which bear a David, a Pippa, a Pompilia without
effort into the region of the highest spiritual vision, appealed less
fully to his imagination than the more complex and embarrassed processes
through which riper minds forge their way towards the completed insight
of a Rabbi ben <a name="page123" id="page123">Ezra</a>. In this sense,
the great song of David has a counterpart in the subtle dramatic study
of the Arab physician Karshish. He also is startled into discovery by a
unique experience. But where David is lifted on and on by a continuous
tide of illuminating thought, perfectly new and strange, but to which
nothing in him opposes the semblance of resistance, Karshish feels only
a mysterious attraction, which he hardly confesses, and which all the
intellectual habits and convictions of a life given up to study and
thought seem to gainsay. No touch of worldly motive belongs to either.
The shepherd-boy is not more single-souled than this devoted "picker up
of learning's crumbs," who makes nothing of perilous and toilsome
journeys for the sake of his art, who is threatened by hungry wild
beasts, stripped and beaten by robbers, arrested as a spy. At every step
his quick scrutiny is rewarded by the discovery of some new drug,
mineral, or herb,&mdash;"things of price"&mdash;"blue
flowering borage, the Aleppo sort," or "Judaea's gum-tragacanth." But
Karshish has much of the temper of Browning himself: these
technicalities are the garb of a deep underlying mysticism. This man's
flesh so admirably made by God is yet but the earthly prison for "that
puff of vapour from his mouth, man's soul." The case of Lazarus, though
at once, as a matter of course, referred to the recognised medical
categories, yet strangely puzzles and arrests him, with a fascination
that will not be put by. This abstracted docile man of perfect physical
vigour, who heeds the approach of <a name="page124" id="page124">the</a>
Roman avenger as he would the passing of a woman with gourds by the way,
and is yet no fool, who seems apathetic and yet loves the very brutes
and the flowers of the field,&mdash;compels his scrutiny, as a
phenomenon of soul, and it is with the eye of a psychological idealist
rather than of a physician that he interprets him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"He holds on firmly to some thread of
     life&mdash; ...<br />
     Which runs across some vast distracting orb<br />
     Of glory on either side that meagre thread,<br />
     Which, conscious of, he must not enter yet&mdash;<br />
     The spiritual life around the earthly life:<br />
     The law of that is known to him as this,<br />
     His heart and brain move there, his feet stay here.<br />

</div>

<p class="noindent">Lazarus stands where Paracelsus conceived that he
himself stood: he "knows God's secret while he holds the thread of
life"; he lives in the glare of absolute knowledge, an implicit
criticism of the Paracelsian endeavour to let in upon men the searing
splendour of the unclouded day. To Karshish, however, these very
embarrassments&mdash;so unlike the knowing cleverness of the spiritual
charlatan&mdash;make it credible that Lazarus is indeed no oriental
Sludge, but one who has verily seen God. But then came the terrible
crux,&mdash;the pretension, intolerable to Semitic monotheism, that God
had been embodied in a man. The words scorch the paper as he writes,
and, like Ferishtah, he will not repeat them. <a name="page125"
id="page125">Yet</a> he cannot escape the spell of the witness, and the
strange thought clings tenaciously to him, defying all the evasive
shifts of a trained mind, and suddenly overmastering him when his
concern with it seems finally at an end&mdash;when his letter is
finished, pardon asked, and farewell said&mdash;in that great outburst,
startling and unforeseen yet not incredible:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"The very God! think, Abib; dost thou think?<br />
      So, the All-Great were the All-Loving too,&mdash;<br />
      So, through the thunder comes a human voice<br />
      Saying, 'O heart I made, a heart beats here!'<br />
      Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That words like these, intensely Johannine in
conception, should seem to start naturally from a mind which just before
has shrunk in horror from the idea of an approximation between God and
that which He fashioned, is an extraordinary <i>tour de force</i> of
dramatic portraiture. Among the minor traits which contribute to it is
one of a kind to which Browning rarely resorts. The "awe" which invests
Lazarus is heightened by a mystic setting of landscape. The visionary
scene of his first meeting with Karshish, though altogether
Browningesque in detail, is Wordsworthian in its mysterious effect upon
personality:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"I crossed a ridge of short, sharp, broken
     hills<br />
     Like an old lion's cheek teeth. Out there came<br />
     A moon made like a face with certain spots<br />
     Multiform, manifold and menacing:<br />
     Then a wind rose behind me."</p>
</div>

<a name="page126" id="page126"></a>
<p>A less formidable problem is handled in the companion study of
<i>Cleon</i>. The Greek mind fascinated Browning, though most of his
renderings of it have the savour of a salt not gathered in Attica, and
his choice of types shows a strong personal bias. From the heroic and
majestic elder art of Greece he turns with pronounced preference to
Euripides the human and the positive, with his facile and versatile
intellect, his agile criticism, and his "warm tears." It is somewhat
along these lines that he has conceived his Greek poet of the days of
Karshish, confronted, like the Arab doctor, with the "new thing." As
Karshish is at heart a spiritual idealist, for all his preoccupation
with drugs and stones, so Cleon, a past-master of poetry and painting,
is among the most positive and worldly-wise of men. He looks back over a
life scored with literary triumphs, as Karshish over his crumbs of
learning gathered at the cost of blows and obloquy. But while Karshish
has the true scholar's dispassionate and self-effacing thirst for
knowledge, Cleon measures his achievements with the insight of an
epicurean artist. He gathers in luxuriously the incense of universal
applause,&mdash;his epos inscribed on golden plates, his songs rising
from every fishing-bark at nightfall,&mdash;and wistfully contrasts the
vast range of delights which as an artist he imagines, with the limited
pleasures which as a man he enjoys. The magnificent symmetry, the
rounded completeness of his life, suffer a serious deduction here, and
his Greek sense of harmony suffers offence as well as his human hunger
for joy. He <a name="page127" id="page127">is</a> a thorough realist,
and finds no satisfaction in contemplating what he may not possess. Art
itself suffers disparagement, as heightening this vain capacity of
contemplation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"I know the joy of kingship: well, thou art
     king!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With great ingenuity this Greek realism is made the
stepping-stone to a conception of immortality as un-Greek as that of the
Incarnation is un-Semitic. Karshish shrank intuitively from a conception
which fascinated while it awed; to Cleon a future state in which joy and
capability will be brought again to equality seems a most plausible
supposition, which he only rejects with a sigh for lack of outer
evidence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Zeus has not yet revealed it; and alas,<br />
      He must have done so, were it possible!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The little vignette in the opening lines finely
symbolises the brilliant Greek decadence, as does the closing picture in
Karshish the mystic dawn of the Earth. Here the portico, flooded with
the glory of a sun about to set, profusely heaped with treasures of art;
there the naked uplands of Palestine, and the moon rising over jagged
hills in a wind-swept sky.</p>

<p>In was in such grave <i>adagio</i> notes as these that Browning chose
to set forth the "intimations of immortality" in the meditative wisdom
and humanity of heathendom. The after-fortunes of the Christian legend,
on the other hand, and the naïve ferocities and fantasticalities of the
medieval world provoked him rather to <a name="page128"
id="page128"><i>scherzo</i></a>,&mdash;audacious and inimitable
<i>scherzo</i>, riotously grotesque on the surface, but with a
grotesqueness so penetrated and informed by passion that it becomes
sublime. <i>Holy-Cross Day</i> and <i>The Heretic's Tragedy </i> both
culminate, like <i>Karshish</i> and <i>Clean</i>, in a glimpse of
Christ. But here, instead of being approached through stately avenues of
meditation, it is wrung from the grim tragedy of persecution and
martyrdom. The Jews, packed like rats to hear the sermon, mutter under
their breath the sublime song of Ben Ezra, one of the most poignant
indictments of Christianity in the name of Christ ever conceived:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"We withstood Christ then? Be mindful how<br />
      At least we withstand Barabbas now!<br />
      Was our outrage sore? But the worst we spared,<br />
      To have called these&mdash;Christians, had we dared!<br />
      Let defiance of them pay mistrust of Thee,<br />
      And Rome make amends for Calvary!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And John of Molay, as he burns in Paris Square,
cries upon "the Name he had cursed with all his life." The
<i>Tragedy</i> stands alone in literature; Browning has written nothing
more original. Its singularity springs mainly from a characteristic and
wonderfully successful attempt to render several planes of emotion and
animus through the same tale. The "singer" looks on at the burning, the
very embodiment of the robust, savagely genial spectator, with a keen
eye for all the sporting-points in the exhibition,&mdash;noting that the
fagots are piled to the right height and are of the right quality&mdash;</p>

<a name="page129" id="page129"></a>
<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Good sappy bavins that kindle forthwith, ...<br />
     <span class="in1">Larch-heart that chars to a chalk-white glow:"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and when the torch is clapt-to and he has "leapt
back safe," poking jests and gibes at the victim. But through this
distorting medium we see the soul of John himself, like a gleam-lit
landscape through the whirl of a storm; a strange weird sinister thing,
glimmering in a dubious light between the blasphemer we half see in him
with the singer's eyes and the saint we half descry with our own. Of
explicit pathos there is not a touch. Yet how subtly the inner pathos
and the outward scorn are fused in the imagery of these last stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Ha, ha, John plucketh now at his rose<br />
     <span class="in1">To rid himself of a sorrow at heart!</span><br />

     <p class="noindent">So, as John called now, through the fire amain,<br />

</div>

<p>None of these dramatic studies of Christianity attracted so lively an
interest as <i>Bishop Blougram's Apology.</i> It was "actual" beyond
anything he had yet <a name="page130" id="page130">done</a>; it
portrayed under the thinnest of veils an illustrious Catholic prelate
familiar in London society; it could be enjoyed with little or no
feeling for poetry; and it was amazingly clever. Even Tennyson, his
loyal friend but unwilling reader, excepted it, on the last ground, from
his slighting judgment upon <i>Men and Women</i> at large. The figure of
Blougram, no less than his discourse, was virtually new in Browning, and
could have come from him at no earlier time. He is foreshadowed, no
doubt, by a series of those accomplished mundane ecclesiastics whom
Browning at all times drew with so keen a zest,&mdash;by Ogniben, the
bishop in <i>Pippa Passes,</i> the bishop of St Praxed's. But mundane as
he is, he bears the mark of that sense of the urgency of the Christian
problem which since <i>Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day</i> had so largely
and variously coloured Browning's work. It occurred to none of those
worldly bishops to justify their worldliness,&mdash;it was far too
deeply ingrained for that. But Blougram's brilliant defence, enormously
disproportioned as it is to the insignificance of the attack, marks his
tacit recognition of loftier ideals than he professes. Like Cleon, he
bears involuntary witness to what he repudiates.</p>

<p>But there is much more in Blougram than this. The imposing personality
of Wiseman contained much to attract and conciliate a poet like
Browning, whose visionary idealism went along with so unaffected a
relish for the world and the talents which succeed there. A great
spiritual ruler, performing with congenial ease the
<a name="page131" id="page131">enormous</a> and varied
functions of his office, and with intellectual resources, when they were
discharged, to win distinction in scholarship, at chess, in society,
appealed powerfully to Browning's congenital delight in all strong and
vivid life. He was a great athlete, who had completely mastered his
circumstances and shaped his life to his will. Opposed to a man of this
varied and brilliant achievement, an ineffectual dilettante appeared a
sorry creature enough; and Browning, far from taking his part and
putting in his craven mouth the burning retorts which the reader in vain
expects, makes him play helplessly with olive-stones while the great
bishop rolls him out his mind, and then, as one cured and confuted,
betake himself to the life of humbler practical activity and social
service.</p>

<p>It is plain that the actual Blougram offered tempting points of
contact with that strenuous ideal of life which he was later to preach
through the lips of "Rabbi ben Ezra." Even what was most problematic in
him, his apparently sincere profession of an outworn creed, suggested the
difficult feat of a gymnast balancing on a narrow edge, or forcibly
holding his unbelief in check,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Kept quiet like the snake 'neath Michael's foot,<br />
      Who stands calm just because he feels it writhe."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But Browning marks clearly the element both of
self-deception and deliberate masquerade in Blougram's defence. He made
him "say right things and call them by wrong names." The intellectual
athlete in him went out to the intellectual athlete in the other, and
rejoiced in <a name="page132" id="page132">every</a> equation he seemed
to establish. He played, and made Blougram play, upon the elusive
resemblance between the calm of effortless mastery and that of hardly
won control.</p>

<p>The rich and varied poetry reviewed in the last three sections
occupies less than half of <i>Men and Women</i>, and leaves the second
half of the title unexplained. In that richer emotional atmosphere which
breathes from every line of his Italian work, the profound fulfilment of
his spiritual needs which he found in his home was the most vital and
potent element. His imaginative grasp of every kind of spiritual energy,
of every "incident of soul," was deepened by his new but incessant and
unqualified experience of love. His poetry focussed itself more
persistently than ever about those creative energies akin to love, of
which art in the fullest sense is the embodiment, and religion the
recognition. It would have been strange if the special form of
love-experience to which the quickening thrill was due had remained
untouched by it. In fact, however, the title of the volume is
significant as well as accurate; for Browning's poetry of the love
between men and women may be said, save for a few simple though
exquisite earlier notes, to begin with it.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The love-poetry of the <i>Men and Women</i> volumes, as originally
published, was the most abundant and various, if not the most striking,
part of its contents. It was almost entirely transferred, in the
collected edition of <a name="page133" id="page133">his</a> Poems issued
in 1863, to other rubrics, to the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>, of which it
now forms the great bulk, and to the <i>Dramatic Romances</i>. But of
Browning's original "fifty men and women," nearly half were lovers or
occupied with love. Such fertility was natural enough in the first years
of a supremely happy marriage, crowning an early manhood in which love
of any kind had, for better or worse, played hardly any part at all. Yet
almost nothing in these beautiful and often brilliant lyrics is in any
strict sense personal. The biographer who searches them
for traits quivering with intimate experience searches all but in vain.
Browning's own single and supreme passion touched no fountain of song,
such as love sets flowing in most poets and in many who are not poets:
even the memorable months of 1845-46 provoked no Sonnets "<i>to</i> the
Portuguese." His personal story impresses itself upon his poetry only
through the preoccupation which it induces with the love-stories of
other people, mostly quite unlike his own. The white light of his own
perfect union broke from that prismatic intellect of his in a poetry
brilliant with almost every other hue. No English poet of his century,
and few of any other, have made love seem so wonderful; but he
habitually takes this wonder bruised and jostled in the grip of
thwarting conditions. In his way of approaching love Browning strangely
blends the mystic's exaltation with the psychologist's cool penetrating
scrutiny of its accompanying phenomena, its favourable or impeding
conditions. The keen analytic accent of Paracelsus mingles with the
ecstatic unearthly <a name="page134" id="page134">note</a> of Shelley.
"Love is all" might have served as the text for the whole volume of
Browning's love-poetry; but the text is wrought out with an amazingly
acute vision for all the things which are not love. "Love triumphing
over the world" might have been the motto for most of the love-poems in
<i>Men and Women</i>; but some would have had to be assigned to the
opposite rubric, "The world triumphing over love." Sometimes Love's
triumph is, for Browning, the rapture of complete union, for which all
outer things exist only by subduing themselves to its mood and taking
its hue; sometimes it is the more ascetic and spiritual triumph of an
unrequited lover in the lonely glory of his love.</p>

<p>The triumph of Browning's united lovers has often a superb Elizabethan
note of defiance. Passion obliterates for them the past and throws a
mystically hued veil over Nature. The gentle Romantic sentiments hardly
touch the fresh springs of their emotion. They may meet and woo "among
the ruins," as Coleridge met and wooed his Genevieve "beside the ruined
tower"; but their song does not, like his, "suit well that ruin old and
hoary," but, on the contrary, tramples with gay scorn upon the lingering
memories of the ruined city,&mdash;a faded pageant yoked to its triumphal
car.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Oh heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns!<br />
     <span class="in4">Earth's returns</span><br />

     <span class="in4">Love is best."</span></p>
</div>

<a name="page135" id="page135"></a>
<p class="noindent">Another lover, in <i>My Star</i>, pours lyric
disdain upon his friends for whose purblind common-sense vision the star
which to him "dartled red and blue," now a bird, now a flower, was
just&mdash;a star. More finely touched than either of these is <i>By the
Fireside</i>. After <i>One Word More</i>, to which it is obviously akin,
it is Browning's most perfect rendering of the luminous inner world,
all-sufficing and self-contained, of a rapturous love. The outer world
is here neither thrust aside nor fantastically varied; it is drawn into
the inner world by taking its hue and becoming the confidant and
executant of its will. A landscape so instinct with the hushed awe of
expectation and with a mystic tenderness is hardly to be found elsewhere
save in <i>Christabel</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"We two stood there with never a third,<br />
     <span class="in1">But each by each, as each knew well:</span><br />

     <p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>

     <p class="noindent">A moment after, and hands unseen<br />
     <span class="in1">Were hanging the night around us fast;</span><br />
     But we knew that a bar was broken between<br />

     <p class="noindent">The forests had done it; there they stood;<br />
     <span class="in1">We caught for a moment the powers at play:</span><br />
     They had mingled us so, for once and good,<br />
     <span class="in1">Their work was done&mdash;we might go or stay,</span><br />
     They relapsed to their ancient mood."</p>
</div>

<a name="page136" id="page136"></a>
<p class="noindent"><i>By the Fireside</i> is otherwise memorable as
portraying with whatever disguise the Italian home-life of the poet and
his wife. The famous description of "the perfect wife" as she sat</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Musing by firelight, that great brow<br />
     <span class="in1">And the spirit-small hand propping it,</span><br />
     Yonder, my heart knows how"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">remain among the most living portraitures of that
exquisite but fragile form. Yet neither here nor elsewhere did Browning
care to dwell upon the finished completeness of the perfect union. His
intellectual thirst for the problematic, and his ethical thirst for the
incomplete, combined to hurry him away to the moments of suspense, big
with undecided or unfulfilled fate. The lover among the ruins is
awaiting his mistress; the rapturous expectancy of another waiting lover
is sung in <i>In Three Days</i>. And from the fireside the poet wanders
in thought from that highest height of love which he has won to the
mystic hour before he won it, when the elements out of which his fate
was to be resolved still hung apart, awaiting the magical touch, which
might never be given:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Oh moment, one and infinite!<br />
     <span class="in1">The water slips o'er stock and stone;</span><br />
     The West is tender, hardly bright:<br />
     <span class="in1">How grey at once is the evening grown&mdash;</span><br />
     One star, its chrysolite!</p>

     <p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>

<a name="page137" id="page137"></a>
     <p class="noindent">Oh, the little more, and how much it is!<br />
     <span class="in1">And the little less, and what worlds away!</span><br />
     How a sound shall quicken content to bliss,<br />
     <span class="in1">Or a breath suspend the blood's best play,</span><br />
     And life be a proof of this!"</p>
</div>

<p>But the poet who lingered over these moments of suspended fate did not
usually choose the harmonious solution of them. The "little less" of
incomplete response might "suspend the breath" of the lover, but it was
an inexhaustible inspiration to the poet. It provokes, for instance, the
delicate symbolism of the twin lyrics <i>Love in a Life</i> and <i>Life
in a Love</i>, variations on the same theme&mdash;vain pursuit of the
averted face&mdash;the one a <i>largo</i>, sad, persistent, dreamily
hopeless; the other impetuous, resolute, glad. The dreamier mood is
elaborated in the <i>Serenade at the Villa</i> and <i>One Way of
Love</i>. A few superbly imaginative phrases bring the Italian summer
night about us, sultry, storm-shot, starless, still,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Life was dead, and so was light."</p>
</div>

<p>The Serenader himself is no child of Italy but a meditative Teuton,
who, Hamlet-like, composes for his mistress the answer which he would not
have her give. The lover in <i>One Way of Love</i> is something of a
Teuton too, and has thoughts which break the vehemence of the impact of
his fate. But there is a first moment when he gasps and knits himself
closer to endure&mdash;admirably expressed in the sudden change to a
brief trochaic verse; then the grim mood is dissolved in a
<a name="page138" id="page138">momentary</a> ecstasy of remembrance or
of idea&mdash;and the verse, too, unfolds and releases itself
in sympathy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"She will not hear my music? So!<br />
     <span class="in1">Break the string; fold music's wing;</span><br />
     Suppose Pauline had bade me sing!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or, instead of this systole and diastole
alternation, the glory and the pang are fused and interpenetrated in a
continuous mood. Such a mood furnishes the spiritual woof of one of
Browning's most consummate and one of his loveliest lyrics, <i>The Last
Ride Together</i> and <i>Evelyn Hope</i>. "How are we to take it?" asks
Mr Fotheringham of the latter. "As the language of passion resenting
death and this life's woeful incompleteness? or as a prevision of the
soul in a moment of intensest life?" The question may be asked; yet the
passion of regret which glows and vibrates through it is too suffused
with exalted faith in a final recovery to find poignant expression. This
lyric, with its taking melody, has delighted thousands to whom Browning
is otherwise "obscure," partly because it appeals with naïve audacity at
once to Romantic and to Christian sentiment&mdash;combining the faith in
love's power to seal its object for ever as its own with the Christian
faith in personal immortality&mdash;a personal immortality in which
there is yet marrying and giving in marriage, as Romance demands. <i>The
Last Ride Together</i> has attracted a different audience. Its passion
is of a rarer and more difficult kind, less accessible to the love and
less flattering to the faith of common minds. This lover dreams of no
future <a name="page139" id="page139">recovery</a> of more
than he still retains; his love, once for all, avails nothing; and the
secure faith of Evelyn's lover, that "God creates the love to reward the
love," is not his. His mistress will never "awake and remember and
understand." But that dead form he is permitted to clasp; and in the
rapture of that phantom companionship passion and thought slowly
transfigure and glorify his fate, till from the lone limbo of outcast
lovers he seems to have penetrated to the innermost fiery core of life,
which art and poetry grope after in vain&mdash;to possess that supreme
moment of earth which, prolonged, is heaven.</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"What if heaven be that, fair and strong<br />
      At life's best, with our eyes upturned<br />
      Whither life's flower is first discerned,<br />
     <span class="in1">We, fixed so, ever should so abide?</span><br />
      What if we still ride on, we two<br />
      With life for ever old yet new,<br />
      Changed not in kind but in degree,<br />
      The instant made eternity,&mdash;<br />
      And heaven just prove that I and she<br />
     <span class="in1">Ride, ride together, for ever ride?"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The "glory of failure" is with Browning a familiar
and inexhaustible theme; but its spiritual abstraction here flushes with
the human glory of possession; the æthereal light and dew are mingled
with breath and blood; and in the wonderful long-drawn rhythm of the
verse we hear the steady stride of the horses as they bear their riders
farther and farther in to the visionary land of Romance.</p>

<p>It is only the masculine lover whom Browning allows
<a name="page140" id="page140">thus</a> to get the
better of unreturned love. His women have no such <i>remedia amoris</i>;
their heart's blood will not transmute into the ichor of poetry. It is
women almost alone who ever utter the poignancy of rejected love; in
them it is tragic, unreflecting, unconsolable, and merciless; while
something of his own elastic buoyancy of intellect, his supple optimism,
his analytic, dissipating fancy, infused itself into his portrayal of
the grief-pangs of his own sex. This distinction is very apparent in the
group of lyrics which deal with the less complete divisions of love. An
almost oppressive intensity of womanhood pulses in <i>A Woman's Last
Word, In a Year</i>, and <i>Any Wife to Any Husband</i>: the first, with
its depth of self-abasement and its cloying lilting melody, trembles,
exquisite as it is, on the verge of the "sentimental." There is a rarer,
subtler pathos in <i>Two in the Campagna</i>. The outward scene finds
its way to his senses, and its images make a language for his mood, or
else they break sharply across it and sting it to a cry. He feels the
Campagna about him, with its tranced immensity lying bare to heaven:&mdash;</p>

nature he would fain also "be unashamed of soul" and probe
<a name="page141" id="page141">love's</a> wound to the core. But the
invisible barriers will not be put aside or transcended, and in the
midst of that "infinite passion" there remain "the finite hearts that
yearn." Or else he wakes after the quarrel in the blitheness of a bright
dawn:&mdash;</p>

<p>The disasters of love rarely, with Browning, stir us very deeply. His
temperament was too elastic, his intellect too resourceful, to enter
save by artificial processes into the mood of blank and hopeless grief.
Tragedy did not lie in his blood, and fortune&mdash;kinder to the man
than to the poet&mdash;had as yet denied him, in love, the "baptism of
sorrow" which has wrung immortal verse from the lips of frailer men. It
may even be questioned whether all Browning's poetry of love's tragedy
will live as long as a few stanzas of Musset's <i>Nuits</i>,&mdash;bare,
unadorned verses, devoid of fancy or wit, but intense and penetrating as
a cry:&mdash;</p>

Musset, <i>Nuit de décembre</i>.
</div>

<p>The same quest of the problematic which attracted Browning to the
poetry of passion repelled or unrequited made him a curious student also
of fainter and feebler "wars of love"&mdash;embryonic or simulated forms
of passion which stood still farther from his personal experience. <i>A
Light Woman, A Pretty Woman</i>, and <i>Another Way of Love</i> are
refined studies in this world of half tones. But the most important and
individual poem of this group is <i>The Statue and the Bust</i>, an
excellent example of the union in Browning of the Romantic temper with a
peculiar mastery of everything in human nature which traverses and
repudiates Romance. The duke and the lady are simpler and slighter
Hamlets&mdash;Hamlets who have no agonies of self-questioning and
self-reproach; intervening in the long pageant of the famous lovers of
romantic tradition with the same disturbing shock as he in the bead-roll
of heroic avengers. The poet's indignant denunciation of his lovers at
the close, apparently for not violating the vows of marriage, is
puzzling to readers who do not appreciate the extreme
<a name="page143" id="page143">subtlety</a> of Browning's use of figure.
He was at once too much and too little of a casuist,&mdash;too
habituated to fine distinctions and too unaware of the pitfalls they
often present to others,&mdash;to understand that in condemning his
lovers for wanting the energy to commit a crime he could be supposed to
imply approval of the crime they failed to commit.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the outer periphery of his love poetry belong his rare and
fugitive "dreams" of love. <i>Women and Roses</i> has an intoxicating
swiftness and buoyancy of music. But there is another and more sinister
kind of love-dream&mdash;the dream of an unloved woman. Such a dream,
with its tragic disillusion, Browning painted in his poignant and
original <i>In a Balcony</i>. It is in no sense a drama, but a dramatic
incident in three scenes, affecting the fates of three persons, upon
whom the entire interest is concentrated. The three vivid and impressive
character-heads stand out with intense and minute brilliance from a
background absolutely blank and void. Though the scene is laid in a
court and the heroine is a queen, there is no bustle of political
intrigue, no conflict between the rival attractions of love and power,
as in <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>. Love is the absorbing preoccupation of
this society, the ultimate ground of all undertakings. There is vague
talk of diplomatic victories, of dominions annexed, of public
thanksgivings; but the statesman who has achieved all this did it all to
win the hand of a girl, and the aged queen whom he has so successfully
served has secretly dreamed all the time, <a name="page144"
id="page144">though</a> already wedded, of being his. For a brilliant
young minister to fail to make love to his sovereign, in spite of her
grey hairs and the marriage law, is a kind of high treason. In its
social presuppositions this community belongs to a world as visionary as
the mystic dream-politics of M. Maeterlinck. But, those presuppositions
granted, everything in it has the uncompromising clearness and
persuasive reality that Browning invariably communicates to his dreams.
The three figures who in a few hours taste the height of ecstasy and
then the bitterness of disillusion or severance, are drawn with
remarkable psychologic force and truth. For all three love is the
absorbing passion, the most real thing in life, scornfully contrasted
with the reflected joys of the painter or the poet. Norbert's noble
integrity is of a kind which mingles in duplicity and intrigue with
disastrous results; he is too invincibly true to himself easily to act a
part; but he can control the secret hunger of his heart and give no
sign, until the consummate hour arrives when he may</p>

      And liberate to beauty life's great need<br />

      Suppress'd itself erewhile."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the ecstasy of release from that suppression,
every tree and flower seems to be an embodiment of the harmonious
freedom he had so long foregone, as Wordsworth, chafing
<a name="page145" id="page145">under</a> his unchartered freedom, saw
everywhere the willing submission to Duty. Even</p>

<div class="poem">

      In harmony with truth, ourselves being true!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But it is the two women who attract Browning's most
powerful handling. One of them, the Queen, has hardly her like for pity
and dread. A "lavish soul" long starved, but kindling into the ecstasy
of girlhood at the seeming touch of love; then, as her dream is
shattered by the indignant honesty of Norbert, transmuted at once into
the daemonic Gudrun or Brynhild, glaring in speechless white-heat and
implacable frenzy upon the man who has scorned her proffered heart and
the hapless girl he has chosen.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref38"
id="fnref38" href="#fn38">[38]</a></span> Between these powerful, <a
name="page146" id="page146">rigid</a>, and simple natures stands
Constance, ardent as they, but with the lithe and palpitating ardour of
a flame. She is concentrated Romance. Her love is an intense emotion;
but some of its fascination lies in its secrecy,&mdash;</p>

     <p class="quote">"Complots inscrutable, deep telegraphs,<br />

</div>

<p class="noindent">she shrinks from a confession which "at the best"
will deprive their love of its spice of danger and make them even as
their "five hundred openly happy friends." She loves adventure, ruse,
and stratagem for their own sake. But she is also romantically generous,
and because she "owes this withered woman everything," is eager to
sacrifice her own hopes of happiness.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn38" id="fn38" href="#fnref38">[38]</a></span>
An anecdote to which Prof. Dowden has lately called attention
(<i>Browning</i>, p. 66) describes Browning in his last years as
demurring to the current interpretation of the <i>dénoûment</i>. Some
one had remarked that it was "a natural sequence that the guard should
be heard coming to take Norbert to his doom." "'Now I don't quite think
that,' answered Browning, <i>as if he were following out the play as a
spectator</i>. 'The queen has a large and passionate temperament.... She
would have died by a knife in her heart. The guard would have come to
carry away her dead body.'" The catastrophe here suggested is
undoubtedly far finer tragedy. But we cannot believe that this was what
Browning originally meant to happen. That Norbert and Constance expect
"doom" is obvious, and the queen's parting "glare" leaves the reader in
no doubt that they are right. They may, nevertheless, be wrong; but
what, then, is meant by the coming of the guard, and the throwing open
of the doors? The queen has in any case not died on the stage, for she
had left it; and if she died outside, how should they have come "to
carry away her dead body"?
</div>

<p>Were it not for its unique position in Browning's poetry, one might
well be content with a passing tribute to the great love canticle which
closes <i>Men and Women</i>&mdash;the crown, as it is in a pregnant
sense the nucleus, of the whole. But here, for "once, and only once, and
for one only," not only the dramatic instinct, which habitually coloured
all his speech, but the reticence which so hardly permitted it to
disclose his most intimate personal emotion, were deliberately
overcome&mdash;overcome, however, only in order, as it were, to explain
and justify their more habitual sway. All the poetry in it is reached
<a name="page147" id="page147">through</a> the endeavour to
find speaking symbols for a love that cannot be told. The poet is a high
priest, entering with awed steps the sanctuary which even he cannot
tread without desecration save after divesting himself of all that is
habitual and of routine,&mdash;even the habits of his genius and the
routine of his art. Unable to divest himself of his poetry altogether,
for he has no other art, he lays aside his habitual dramatic guise to
speak, for once, not as Lippo, Roland, or Andrea, but "in his true
person." And he strips off the veil of his art and speaks in his own
person only to declare that speech is needless, and to fall upon that
exquisite symbol of an esoteric love uncommunicated and incommunicable
to the apprehension of the world,&mdash;the moon's other face with all
its "silent silver lights and darks," undreamed of by any mortal.
"Heaven's gift takes man's abatement," and poetry itself may only hint
at the divinity of perfect love. The <i>One Word More</i> was written in
September 1855, shortly before the publication of the volume it closed,
as the old moon waned over the London roofs. Less than six years later
the "moon of poets" had passed for ever from his ken.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The catastrophe of June 29, 1861, closed with
appalling suddenness the fifteen years' married life of Browning. "I
shall grow still, I hope," he wrote to Miss Haworth, a month later, "but
my root is taken, and remains." The words vividly express the valour in
the midst of desolation which animated one little tried hitherto by
sorrow. The Italian home was shattered, and no thought of even
attempting a patched-up existence in its ruined walls seems to have
occurred to him; even the neighbourhood of the spot in which all that
was mortal of her had been laid had no power to detain him. But his
departure was no mere flight from scenes <a name="page149"
id="page149">intolerably</a> dear. He had their child to educate and his
own life to fulfil, and he set himself with grim resolution to the work,
as one who had indeed <i>had everything</i>, but who was as little
inclined to abandon himself to the past as to forget it. After visiting
his father in Paris&mdash;the "dear <i>nonno</i>" of his wife's charming
letters<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref39" id="fnref39"
href="#fn39">[39]</a></span>&mdash;he settled in London, at first in
lodgings, then at the house in Warwick Crescent which was for a quarter
of a century to be his home. Something of that dreary first winter found
its way, ten years later, through whatever dramatic disguise, into the
poignant epilogue of <i>Fifine</i>. Browning had been that
"Householder," had gone through the dragging days and nights,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"All the fuss and trouble of street-sounds,
     window-sights,<br />
     All the worry of flapping door and echoing roof; and then<br />
     All the fancies,"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">perhaps, among them, that of the "knock, call, cry,"
and the pang and rapture of the visionary meeting. Certainly one of the
effects of his loss was to accentuate the mood of savage isolation which
lurked beneath Browning's genial sociality. The world from which his
saint had been snatched looked very common, sordid, and mean, and he
resented its intrusiveness on occasion with startling violence. When
proposals were made in 1863 in various quarters to publish her life, he
turned like a wild beast upon the "blackguards" who "thrust their paws
into his bowels" by prying into his intimacies. <a name="page150"
id="page150">To</a> the last he dismissed similar proposals by critics
of the highest status with a cavalier bluntness highly surprising to
persons who only knew him as the man of punctilious observance and
fastidious good form. For the rest, London contained much that was bound
by degrees to temper the gloom and assuage the hostility. Florence and
Rome could furnish nothing like the circle of men of genius and varied
accomplishment, using like himself the language of Shakespeare and
Milton, in which he presently began to move as an intimate. Thackeray,
Ruskin, Tennyson, Carlyle, Rossetti, Leighton, Woolner, Prinsep, and
many more, added a kind of richness to his life which during the last
fifteen years he had only enjoyed at intervals. And the flock of old
friends who accepted Browning began to be reinforced by a crowd of
unknown readers who proclaimed him. Tennyson was his loyal comrade; but
the prestige of Tennyson's popularity had certainly blocked many of the
avenues of Browning's fame, appealing as the Laureate largely did to
tastes in poetry which Browning rudely traversed or ignored. On the
Tennysonian reader <i>pur sang</i> Browning's work was pretty sure to
make the impression so frankly described by Frederick Tennyson to his
brother, of "Chinese puzzles, trackless labyrinths, unapproachable
nebulosities." Even among these intimates of his own generation were
doubtless some who, with F. Tennyson again, believed him to be "a man of
infinite learning, jest, and bonhomie, and a sterling heart that reverbs
no hollowness," but who yet <a name="page151" id="page151">held</a> "his
school of poetry" to be "the most grotesque conceivable." This was the
tone of the 'Fifties, when Tennyson's vogue was at its height. But with
the 'Sixties there began to emerge a critical disposition to look beyond
the trim pleasances of the Early Victorians to more daring romantic
adventure in search of the truth that lies in beauty, and more fearless
grip of the beauty that lies in truth. The genius of the pre-Raphaelites
began to find response. And so did the yet richer and more composite
genius of Browning. Moreover, the immense vogue won by the poetry of his
wife undoubtedly prepared the way for his more difficult but kindred
work. If <i>Pippa Passes</i> counts for something in <i>Aurora Leigh,
Aurora Leigh</i> in its turn trained the future readers of <i>The Ring
and the Book</i>.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn39" id="fn39" href="#fnref39">[39]</a></span>
His father beautifully said of Mrs Browning's portrait
that it was a face which made the worship of saints seem possible.
</div>

<p>The altered situation became apparent on the publication, in rapid
succession, in 1864, of Browning's <i>Dramatis Personæ</i> and Mr
Swinburne's <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>. Both volumes found their most
enthusiastic readers at the universities. "All my new cultivators are
young men," Browning wrote to Miss Blagden; adding, with a touch of
malicious humour, "more than that, I observe that some of my old friends
don't like at all the irruption of outsiders who rescue me from their
sober and private approval, and take those words out of their mouths
which they 'always meant to say,' and never did." The volume included
practically all that Browning had actually written since 1855,&mdash;less
than a score of pieces,&mdash;the somewhat slender harves
<a name="page152" id="page152">of</a> nine years. But
during these later years in Italy, as we have seen, he had done little
at his art; and after his return much time had been occupied in
projecting the great scheme of that which figures in his familiar
letters as his "murder-poem," and was ultimately known as <i>The Ring and
the Book</i>. As a whole, the <i>Dramatis Personæ</i> stands yet more
clearly apart from <i>Men and Women</i> than that does from all that had
gone before. Both books contain some of his most magnificent work; but
the earlier is full of summer light and glow, the later breathes the
hectic and poignant splendour of autumn. The sense of tragic loss broods
over all its music. In lyric strength and beauty there is no decay; but
the dramatic imagination has certainly lost somewhat of its flexible
strength and easy poise of wing: falling back now upon the personal
convictions of the poet, now upon the bald prose of daily life. <i>Rabbi
ben Ezra</i> and <i>Abt Vogler, A Death in the Desert</i>, are as noble
poetry as <i>Andrea del Sarto</i> or <i>The Grammarian's Funeral</i>;
but it is a poetry less charged with the "incidents" of any other soul
than his own; and, on the other hand, <i>Dis Aliter Visum</i> and
<i>Youth and Art</i>, and others, effective as they are, yet move in an
atmosphere less remote from prose than any of the songs and lays of love
which form one of the chief glories of <i>Men and Women</i>. The world
which is neither thrillingly beautiful nor grotesquely ugly, but simply
poor, unendowed, humdrum, finds for the first time a place in his
poetry. Its blankness answered too well to the desolate regard which in
the early 'Sixties he turned <a name="page153" id="page153">upon</a>
life. The women are homely, even plain, like James Lee's wife,
with her "coarse hands and hair," and Edith in <i>Too Late</i>, with her
thin, odd features, or mediocre, like the speaker in <i>Dis Aliter
Visum</i>; and they have homely names, like "Lee" or "Lamb" or "Brown,"
not gratuitously grotesque ones like Blougram, Blouphocks, or the
outrageous "Gigadibs." "Sludge" stands on a different footing; for it is
dramatically expressive, as these are not. The legend of the gold-haired
maiden of Pornic is told with a touch of harsher cynicism than was heard
in Galuppi's "chill" music of the vanished beauties of Venice. If we may
by no means say that the glory of humanity has faded for Browning, yet
its glory has become more fugitive and more extrinsic,&mdash;a "grace not
theirs" brought by love "settling unawares" upon minds "level and low,
burnt and bare" in themselves. And he dwells now on desolate and desert
scenes with a new persistence, just as it was wild primitive nooks of
the French coast which now became his chosen summer resorts in place of
the semi-civic rusticity which had been his choice in Italy. "This is a
wild little place in Brittany," he wrote to Miss Blagden in August 1863;
"close to the sea, a hamlet of a dozen houses, perfectly
lonely&mdash;one may walk on the edge of the low rocks by the sea for
miles.... If I could I would stay just as I am for many a day. I feel
out of the very earth sometimes as I sit here at the window." The wild
coast scenery falls in with the desolate mood of James Lee's wife; the
savage luxuriance of the Isle with the primitive fancies of
<a name="page154" id="page154">Caliban</a>; the arid desert holds in
its embrace, like an oasis, the well-spring of Love which flows from the
lips of the dying Apostle. In the poetry of <i>Men and Women</i> we see
the ripe corn and the flowers in bloom; in <i>Dramatis Personæ</i>, the
processes of Nature are less spontaneous and, as it were, less complete;
the desert and the abounding streams, the unreclaimed human nature and
the fertilising grace of love, emerge in a nearer approach to elemental
nakedness, and there are moods in which each appears to dominate.
Doubtless the mood which finally triumphed was that of the dying John
and of the Third Speaker; but it was a triumph no longer won by "the
happy prompt instinctive way of youth," and the way to it lay through
moods not unlike those of James Lee's wife, whose problem, like his own,
was how to live when the answering love was gone. His "fire," like hers,
was made "of shipwreck wood",<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref40"
id="fnref40" href="#fn40">[40]</a></span> and her words "at the window"
can only be an echo of his&mdash;</p>

The second section of <i>James Lee's Wife, By the Fireside</i>, cannot
have been written without a conscious, and therefore a purposed and
significant, reference to the like-named poem in <i>Men and Women</i>,
which so exquisitely plays with the intimate scenery of his home-life.
</div>

<a name="page155" id="page155"></a>
<p>As her problem is another life-setting of his, so she feels her way
towards its solution through processes which cannot have been strange to
him. She walks "along the Beach," or "on the Cliff," or "among the
rocks," and the voices of sea and wind ("Such a soft sea and such a
mournful wind!" he wrote to Miss Blagden) become speaking symbols in her
preoccupied mind. Not at all, however, in the fashion of the "pathetic
fallacy." She is too deeply disenchanted to imagine pity; and Browning
puts into her mouth (part vi.) a significant criticism of some early
stanzas of his own, in which he had in a buoyant optimistic fashion
interpreted the wailing of the wind.<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref41" id="fnref41" href="#fn41">[41]</a></span>
If Nature has aught to teach, it is the sterner doctrine, that nothing
endures; that Love, like the genial sunlight, has to glorify base
things, to raise the low nature by its throes, sometimes divining the
hidden spark of God in what seemed mere earth, sometimes only lending
its transient splendour to a dead and barren spirit,&mdash;the fiery
grace of a butterfly momentarily obliterating the dull turf or rock it
lights on, but leaving them precisely what they were.</p>

</div>

<p><i>James Lee's Wife</i> is a type of the other idyls of love which
form so large a part of the <i>Dramatis Personæ</i>. The note of
dissonance, of loss, which they sound had been struck by Browning
before, but never with the same persistence and iteration. The
<i>Dramatic Lyrics</i> and <i>Men and Women</i> are not quite silent of
the tragic <a name="page156" id="page156">failure</a> of love; but it is
touched lightly in "swallow flights of song," like the <i>Lost Mistress</i>,
that "dip their wings in tears and skim away." And the lovers are
spiritual athletes, who can live on the memory of a look, and seem to be
only irradiated, not scorched, by the tragic flame. But these lovers of
the 'Sixties are of less ætherial temper; they are more obviously,
familiarly human; the loss of what they love comes home to them, and
there is agony in the purifying fire. Such are the wronged husband in
<i>The Worst of It</i>, and the finally frustrated lover in <i>Too Late</i>.
In the group of "Might-have-been" lyrics the sense of loss is less
poignant and tragic but equally uncompensated. "You fool!" cries the
homely little heroine of <i>Dis Aliter Visum</i> to the elderly scholar
who ten years before had failed to propose to her,&mdash;</p>

<p>It is no accident that with the clearer recognition of sharp and
absolute loss Browning shows increasing <a name="page157"
id="page157">preoccupation</a> with the thought of recovery after death.
For himself death was now inseparably intertwined with all that he had
known of love, and the prospect of the supreme reunion which death, as
he believed, was to bring him, drew it nearer to the core of his
imagination and passion. Not that he looked forward to it with the easy
complacency of the hymn-writer. <i>Prospice</i> would not be the great
uplifting song it is were the note of struggle, of heroic heart to bear
the brunt and pay in one moment all "life's arrears of pain, darkness,
and cold," less clearly sounded; and were the final cry less intense
with the longing of bereavement. How near this thought of rapturous
reunion lay to the springs of Browning's imagination at this time, how
instantly it leapt into poetry, may be seen from the <i>Eurydice to
Orpheus</i> which he fitly placed immediately after these&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"But give them me, the mouth, the eyes, the brow!<br />
     <span class="in1">Let them once more absorb me!"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But in two well-known poems of the <i>Dramatis
Personæ</i> Browning has splendidly unfolded what is implicit in the
strong simple clarion&mdash;note of <i>Prospice</i>. <i>Abt Vogler</i>
and <i>Rabbi ben Ezra</i> are among the surest strongholds of his
popular fame. <i>Rabbi ben Ezra</i> is a great song of life, bearing
more fully perhaps than any other poem the burden of what he had to say
to his generation, but lifted far above mere didacticism by the
sustained glow in which ethical passion, and its imaginative splendour,
indistinguishably blend. It is <a name="page158" id="page158">not</a>
for nothing that Browning put this loftiest utterance of all that was
most strenuous in his own faith into the mouth of a member of the race
which has beyond others known how to suffer and how to transfigure its
suffering. Ben Ezra's thoughts are not all Hebraic, but they are
conceived in the most exalted temper of Hebrew prophecy; blending the
calm of achieved wisdom with the fervour of eagerly accepted discipline,
imperious scorn for the ignorance of fools, and heroic ardour, for the
pangs and throes of the fray. Ideals which, coolly analysed, seem
antithetical, and which have in reality inspired opposite ways of life,
meet in the fusing flame of the Rabbi's impassioned thought: the body is
the soul's beguiling sorceress, but also its helpful comrade; man is the
passive clay which the great Potter moulded and modelled upon the Wheel
of Time, and yet is bidden rage and strive, the adoring acquiescence of
Eastern Fatalism mingling with the Western gospel of individual energy.
And all this complex and manifold ethical appeal is conveyed in verse of
magnificent volume and resonance, effacing by the swift recurrent anvil
crash of its rhythm any suggestion that the acquiescence of the "clay"
means passivity.</p>

<p>In <i>Abt Vogler</i> the prophetic strain is even more daring and
assured; only it springs not from "old experience," but from the lonely
ecstasy of artistic creation. Browning has put into the mouth of his old
Catholic musician the most impassioned and undoubting assertion to be
found in his work of his <a name="page159" id="page159">faith</a> that
nothing good is finally lost. The Abbé's theology may have supplied the
substance of the doctrine, but it could not supply the beautiful, if
daring, expansion of it by which the immortality of men's souls is
extended to "all we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good." This was
the work of music; and the poem is in truth less remarkable for this
rapturous statement of faith than for the penetrating power with which
the mystical and transcendental suggestions of music are explored and
unfolded,&mdash;the mysterious avenues which it seems to open to kinds
of experience more universal than ours, exempt from the limitations of
our narrow faculties, even from the limitations of time and space
themselves. All that is doctrinal and speculative in <i>Abt Vogler</i>
is rooted in musical experience,&mdash;the musical experience,
no doubt, of a richly imaginative mind, for which every organ-note turns
into the symbol of a high romance, till he sees heaven itself yearning
down to meet his passion as it seeks the sky. Of the doctrine and
speculation we may think as we will; of the psychological force and
truth of the whole presentment there can be as little question as of its
splendour and glow. It has the sinew, as well as the wing, of poetry.
And neither in poetry nor in prose has the elementary marvel of the
simplest musical form been more vividly seized than in the well-known
couplet&mdash;</p>

</div>

<a name="page160" id="page160"></a>
<p><i>A Death in the Desert</i>, though a poem of great beauty, must be
set, in intrinsic value, below these two. To attack Strauss through the
mouth of the dying apostle was a smart pamphleteering device; but it
gave his otherwise noble verse a disagreeable twang of theological
disputation, and did no manner of harm to Strauss, who had to be met on
other ground and with other weapons,&mdash;the weapons of history and
comparative religion&mdash;in which Browning's skill was that only of a
brilliant amateur. But the impulse which created it had deeper springs
than this. What is most clearly personal and most deeply felt in it is
the exaltation of love, which seems to have determined the whole
imaginative fabric. Love, Browning's highest expression of spiritual
vitality, was the cardinal principle of his creed; God was vital to him
only as a loving God, and Christ only as the human embodiment and
witness of God's love. The traditional story of Christ was in this sense
of profound significance for him, while he turned away with indifference
or disgust from the whole doctrinal apparatus of the Atonement, which,
however closely bound up with the popular conception of God's love, had
nothing to do with his conception of it, and he could thus consistently
decline the name of Christian, as some witnesses aver that he did.<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref42" id="fnref42" href="#fn42">[42]</a></span>
It was thus in entire keeping with his way of approaching Christianity
that he imagined this moving episode,&mdash;the dying apostle whose
genius had <a name="page161" id="page161">made</a> that way so
singularly persuasive, the little remnant of doomed and
hunted fugitives who seem to belong to earth only by the spiritual bond
of their love to him, as his own physical life is now a firebrand all
but extinct,&mdash;"all ashes save the tip that holds a spark," but that still
glowing with undiminished soul. The material fabric which enshrines this
fine essence of the Christian spirit is of the frailest; and the
contrast is carried out in the scenic setting,&mdash;the dim cool cavern,
with its shadowy depth and faint glimmerings of day, the hushed voices,
the ragged herbage, and the glory in the face of the passing saint
within; without, the hard dazzling glare of the desert noon, and the
burning blue, and the implacable and triumphant might of Rome.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn42" id="fn42" href="#fnref42">[42]</a></span>
Other testimony, it is true, equally strong, asserts that
he accepted the name; in any case he used it in a sense of his own.
</div>

<p>The discourse of the "aged friend" is full of subtle and vivid
thinking, and contains some of Browning's most memorable utterances
about Love, in particular the noble lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"For life with all it yields of joy and woe ...<br />
      Is just our chance of the prize of learning love,<br />
      How love might be, hath been indeed, and is."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nowhere, either, do we see more clearly how this
master-conception of his won control of his reasoning powers, framing
specious ladders to conclusions towards which his whole nature yearned,
but which his vision of the world did not uniformly bear out. Man loved,
and God would not be above man if He did not also love. The horrible
spectre of a God who has power without love never ceased to lurk in the
background of Browning's <a name="page162" id="page162">thought</a>, and
he strove with all his resources of dialectic and poetry to
exorcise it. And no wonder. For a loving God was the very keystone of
Browning's scheme of life and of the world, and its withdrawal would
have meant for him the collapse of the whole structure.</p>

<p>It is no accident that the <i>Death in the Desert</i> is followed
immediately by a theological study in a very different key, <i>Caliban
upon Setebos</i>. For in this brilliantly original "dramatic monologue"
Caliban&mdash;the "savage man"&mdash;appears "mooting the point 'What is
God?'" and constructing his answer frankly from his own nature. It was
quite in Browning's way to take a humorous delight in imagining grotesque
parallels to ideas and processes in which he profoundly believed; a
proclivity aided by the curious subtle relation between his grotesquerie
and his seriousness, which makes <i>Pacchiarotto</i>, for instance,
closely similar in effect to parts of <i>Christmas-Eve</i>. Browning is
one of three or four sons of the nineteenth century who dared to fill in
the outlines, or to complete the half-told tale, of Shakespeare's
Caliban.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref43" id="fnref43"
href="#fn43">[43]</a></span> Kenan's hero is the quondam disciple of
Stephano and Trinculo, finished and matured in the corrupt mob-politics
of Europe; a caustic symbol of democracy, as Renan saw it, alternately
trampling on and patronising culture. Browning's Caliban is far truer to
Shakespeare's conception; he is the Caliban <a name="page163"
id="page163">of</a> Shakespeare, not followed into a new phase but
observed in a different attitude,&mdash;Caliban of the days before the
Storm, an unsophisticated creature of the island, inaccessible to the
wisdom of Europe, and not yet the dupe of its vice. His wisdom, his
science, his arts, are all his own. He anticipates the heady joy of
Stephano's bottle with a mash of gourds of his own invention. And his
religion too is his own,&mdash;no decoction from any of the recognised
vintages of religious thought, but a home-made brew cunningly distilled
from the teeming animal and plant life of the Island. It is a mistake to
call Caliban's theology a study of primitive religion; for primitive
religion is inseparable from the primitive tribe, and Caliban the
savage, who has never known society, was a conception as unhistorical as
it was exquisitely adapted to the individualist ways of Browning's
imagination. Tradition and prescription, which fetter the savage with
iron bonds, exist for Caliban only in the form of the faith held by his
dam, which he puts aside in the calm decisive way of a modern thinker,
as one who has nothing to fear from the penalties of heresy, and has
even outlived the exultation of free thought:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"His dam held that the Quiet made all things<br />
      Which Setebos vexed only: 'holds not so;<br />
      Who made them weak, made weakness He might vex."</p>
</div>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn43" id="fn43" href="#fnref43">[43]</a></span>
It is characteristic that M. Maeterlinck found no place
for Caliban in his striking fantasia on the <i>Tempest, Joyzelle</i>.
</div>

<p class="noindent">Caliban's theology has, moreover, very real points
of contact with Browning's own. His god is that sheer Power which
Browning from the first recognised; it is <a name="page164"
id="page164">because</a> Setebos feels heat and cold, and is therefore a
weak creature with ungratified wants, that Caliban decides there must be
behind him a divinity that "all it hath a mind to, doth." Caliban is one
of Browning's most consummate realists; he has the remorselessly vivid
perceptions of a Lippo Lippi and a Sludge. Browning's wealth of
recondite animal and plant lore is nowhere else so amazingly displayed;
the very character of beast or bird will be hit off in a line,&mdash;as
the pie with the long tongue</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"That pricks deep into oakwarts for a worm,<br />
      And says a plain word when she finds her prize,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or the lumpish sea-beast which he blinded and called
Caliban (an admirable trait)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"A bitter heart that bides its time and bites."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And all this curious scrutiny is reflected in
Caliban's god. The sudden catastrophe at the close</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">("What, what? A curtain o'er the world at once!")</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is one of Browning's most superb surprises, breaking
in upon the leisured ease of theory with the suddenness of a horrible
practical emergency, and compelling Caliban, in the act of repudiating
his theology, to provide its most vivid illustration.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, with bitter irony, brought his half-taught savage into
touch with the scum of modern civilisation, and made them conspire
together against its benignity and wisdom. The reader is apt to remember
this <a name="page165" id="page165">conjunction</a> when he passes from
<i>Caliban</i> to <i>Mr Sludge.</i> Stephano and Trinculo, almost alone
among Shakespeare's rascals, are drawn without geniality, and Sludge is
the only one of Browning's "casuists" whom he treats with open scorn.
That some of the effects were palpably fraudulent, and that, fraud
apart, there remained a residuum of phenomena not easy to explain, were
all irritating facts. Yet no one can mistake <i>Sludge</i> for an
outflow of personal irritation, still less for an act of literary
vengeance upon the impostor who had beguiled the lofty and ardent
intelligence of his wife. The resentful husband is possibly there, but
so elementary an emotion could not possibly have taken exclusive
possession of Browning's complex literary faculty, or baulked the eager
speculative curiosity which he brought to all new and problematic modes
of mind. His attitude towards spiritualism was in fact the product of
strangely mingled conditions. Himself the most convinced believer in
spirit among the poets of his time, he regarded the bogus demonstrations
of the "spiritualist" somewhat as the intellectual sceptic regards the
shoddy logic by which the vulgar unbeliever proves there is no God. But
even this anger had no secure tenure in a nature so rich in solvents for
disdain. It is hard to say where scorn ends and sympathy begins, or
where the indignation of the believer who sees his religion travestied
passes over into the curious interest of the believer who recognises its
dim distorted reflection in the unlikeliest quarters. But Sludge is
clearly permitted, like Blougram before and <a name="page166"
id="page166">Juan</a> and Hohenstiel-Schwangau after him, to assume in
good faith positions, or at least to use, with perfect sincerity,
language, which had points of contact with Browning's own. He has an eye
for "spiritual facts" none the less genuine in its gross way that it has
been acquired in the course of professional training, and is valued as a
professional asset. But his supernaturalism at its best is devoid of
spiritual quality. His "spiritual facts" are collections of miraculous
coincidences raked together by the anteater's tongue of a cool egoist,
who waits for them</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in5">"lazily alive,</span><br />
      Open-mouthed, ...<br />
      Letting all nature's loosely guarded motes<br />
      Settle and, slick, be swallowed."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Like Caliban, who also finds the anteater an
instructive symbol, he sees "the supernatural" everywhere, and
everywhere concerned with himself. But Caliban's religion of terror,
cunning, and cajolery is more estimable than Sludge's business-like
faith in the virtue of wares for which he finds so profitable a market,
and which he gets on such easy terms. Caliban tremblingly does his best
to hitch his waggon to Setebos's star&mdash;when Setebos is looking;
Sludge is convinced that the stars are once for all hitched to his
waggon; that heaven is occupied in catering for his appetite and
becoming an accomplice in his sins. Sludge's spiritual world was genuine
for him, but it had nothing but the name in <a name="page167"
id="page167">common</a> with that of the poet of Ben Ezra, and of the
<i>Epilogue</i> which immediately follows.<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref44" id="fnref44" href="#fn44">[44]</a></span></p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn44" id="fn44" href="#fnref44">[44]</a></span>
The foregoing account assumes that the poem was not
written, as is commonly supposed, in Florence in 1859-60, but after his
settlement in London. The only ground for the current view is Mrs
Browning's mention of his having been "working at a long poem" that
winter (<i>Letters</i>, May 18, 1860). I am enabled, by the kindness of
Prof. Hall Griffin, to state that an unpublished letter from Browning to
Buchanan in 1871 shows this "long poem" to have been one on Napoleon
III. (cf. above, p. <a href="#page90">90</a>). Some of it probably
appears in <i>Hohenstiel Schwangau</i>.
</div>

<p>This <i>Epilogue</i> is one of the few utterances in which Browning
draws the ambiguous dramatic veil from his personal faith. That he
should choose this moment of parting with the reader for such a
confession confirms one's impression that the focus of his interest in
poetry now, more than ever before, lay among those problems of life and
death, of God and man, to which nearly all the finest work of this
collection is devoted. Far more emphatically than in the analogous
<i>Christmas-Eve</i>, Browning resolves not only the negations of
critical scholarship but the dogmatic affirmations of the Churches into
symptoms of immaturity in the understanding of spiritual things; in the
knowledge how heaven's high with earth's low should intertwine. The
third speaker voices the manifold protest of the nineteenth century
against all theologies built upon an aloofness of the divine and human,
whether the aloof God could be reached by special processes and
ceremonies, or whether he was a bare abstraction, whose
<a name="page168" id="page168">"pale bliss"</a> never thrilled in
response to human hearts. The best comment upon his faith is the saying
of Meredith, "The fact that character can be and is developed by the
clash of circumstances is to me a warrant for infinite hope."<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref45" id="fnref45" href="#fn45">[45]</a></span>
Only, for Browning, that "infinite hope" translates itself into a sense
of present divine energies bending all the clashing circumstance to its
benign end, till the walls of the world take on the semblance of the
shattered Temple, and the crowded life within them the semblance of the
seemingly vanished Face, which</p>

The last line is pantheistic in expression, and has been
so understood by some, particularly by Mr J.M. Robertson. But pantheism
was at most a tendency, which the stubborn concreteness of his mind held
effectually in check; a point, one might say, upon which his thinking
converges, but which it never even proximately attains. God and the Soul
never mingle, however intimate their communion. Cf. chap. <a

</div>

<p class="noindent">After four years of silence, the <i>Dramatis
Personæ</i> was followed by <i>The Ring and the Book</i>. This
monumental poem, in some respects his culminating achievement, has its
roots in an earlier stratum of his life than its predecessor. There is
little here to recall the characteristic moods of his first years of
desolate widowhood&mdash;the valiant Stoicism, the acceptance of the
sombre present, the great forward gaze upon the world beyond. We are in
Italy once more, our senses tingle with its glowing prodigality of day,
we jostle the teeming throng of the Roman streets, and are drawn into
the vortex of a vast debate which seems to occupy the entire
<a name="page170" id="page170">community</a>, and which turns, not upon
immortality, or spiritualism, or the nature of God, or the fate of man,
but on the guilt or innocence of the actors in one pitiful
drama,&mdash;a priest, a noble, an illiterate girl.</p>

<p>With the analytic exuberance of one to whom the processes of Art were
yet more fascinating than its products, Browning has described how he
discovered this forgotten tale and forged its glowing metal into the
<i>Ring</i>. The chance finding of an "old square yellow book" which
aroused his curiosity among the frippery of a Florentine stall, was as
grotesquely casual an inception as poem ever had. But it was one of
those accidents which, suddenly befalling a creative mind, organise its
loose and scattered material with a magical potency unattainable by
prolonged cogitation. The story of Pompilia took shape in the gloom and
glare of a stormy Italian night of June 1860, as he watched from the
balcony of Casa Guidi. The patient elaboration of after-years wrought
into consummate expressiveness the <i>donnée</i> of that hour. But the
conditions under which the elaboration was carried out were pathetically
unlike those of the primal vision. Before the end of June in the
following year Mrs Browning died, and Browning presently left Florence
for ever. For the moment all the springs of poetry were dried up, and it
is credible enough that, as Mrs Orr says, Browning abandoned all thought
of a poem, and even handed over his material to another. But within a
few months, it is clear, the story of Pompilia not merely recovered <a
name="page171" id="page171">its</a> hold upon his imagination, but
gathered a subtle hallowing association with what was most spiritual in
that vanished past of which it was the last and most brilliant gift. The
poem which enshrined Pompilia was thus instinct with reminiscence; it
was, with all its abounding vitality, yet commemorative and memorial;
and we understand how Browning, no friend of the conventions of poetic
art, entered on and closed his giant task with an invocation to the
"Lyric Love," as it were the Urania, or heavenly Muse, of a modern epic.</p>

<p>The definite planning of the poem in its present shape belongs to the
autumn of 1862. In September 1862 he wrote to Miss Blagden from Biarritz
of "my new poem which is about to be, and of which the whole is pretty
well in my head&mdash;the Roman murder-story, you know."<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref47" id="fnref47" href="#fn47">[47]</a></span>
After the completion of the <i>Dramatis Personæ</i> in 1863-64, the
"Roman murder-story" became his central occupation. To it three quiet
early morning hours were daily given, and it grew steadily under his
hand. For the rest he began to withdraw from his seclusion, to mix
freely in society, to "live and like earth's way." He talked openly
among his literary friends of <a name="page172" id="page172">the</a>
poem and its progress, rumour and speculation busied themselves with it
as never before with work of his, and the literary world at large looked
for its publication with eager and curious interest. At length, in
November 1868, the first instalment was published. It was received by
the most authoritative part of the press with outspoken, even
dithyrambic eulogies, in which the severely judicial <i>Athenæum</i>
took the lead. Confirmed sceptics or deriders, like Edward FitzGerald,
rubbed their eyes and tried once again, in vain, to make the old
barbarian's verses construe and scan. To critics trained in classical
traditions the original structure of the poem was extremely disturbing;
and most of FitzGerald's friends shared, according to him, the opinion
of Carlyle, who roundly pronounced it "without <i>Backbone</i> or
basis of Common-sense," and "among the absurdest books ever written by a
gifted Man." Tennyson, however, admitted (to FitzGerald) that he "found
greatness" in it,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref48" id="fnref48"
href="#fn48">[48]</a></span> and Mr Swinburne was in the forefront of
the chorus of praise. The audience which now welcomed Browning was in
fact substantially that which had hailed the first fresh runnels of Mr
Swinburne's genius a few years before; the fame of both marked a wave of
reaction from the austere simplicity and attenuated sentiment of the
later <i>Idylls of the King</i>. Readers upon whom the shimmering
exquisiteness of Arthurian knighthood began to pall turned with relish
to Browning's <a name="page173" id="page173">Italian</a> murder story,
with its sensational crime, its mysterious elopement, its problem
interest, its engaging actuality.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn47" id="fn47" href="#fnref47">[47]</a></span>
W.M. Rossetti reports Browning to have told him, in a call, March 15,
1868, that he "began it in October 1864. Was staying at Bayonne, and
walked out to a mountain-gorge traditionally said to have been cut or
kicked out by Roland, and there laid out the full plan of his twelve
cantos, accurately carried out in the execution." The date is presumably
an error of Rossetti's for 1862 (<i>Rossetti Papers</i>, p. 302). Cf.
Letter of Sept. 29, 1862 (Orr, p. 259).

<i>More Letters</i> of E.F.G.
</div>

<p>And undoubtedly this was part of the attraction of the theme for
Browning himself. He had inherited his father's taste for stories of
mysterious crime.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref49" id="fnref49"
href="#fn49">[49]</a></span> And to the detective's interest in probing
a mystery, which seems to have been uppermost in the elder Browning, was
added the pleader's interest in making out an ingenious and plausible
case for each party. The casuist in him, the lover of argument as such,
and the devoted student of Euripides,<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref50" id="fnref50" href="#fn50">[50]</a></span> seized with
delight upon a forensic subject which made it natural to introduce the
various "persons of the drama," giving their individual testimonies and
"apologies." He avails himself remorselessly of all the pretexts for
verbosity, for iteration, for sophistical invention, afforded by the
cumbrous machinery of the law, and its proverbial delay. Every detail is
examined from every point of view. Little that is sordid or revolting is
suppressed. But then it is assuredly a mistake to represent, with one of
the liveliest of Browning's recent exponents, that the story was for him,
even at the outset, in the stage of "crude fact," merely a common and
<a name="page174" id="page174">sordid</a> tale like a hundred others,
picked up "at random" from a rubbish-heap to be subjected to the alchemy
of imagination by way of showing the infinite worth of "the
insignificant." Rather, he thought that on that broiling June day, a
providential "Hand" had "pushed" him to the discovery, in that unlikely
place, of a forgotten treasure, which he forthwith pounced upon with
ravishment as a "prize." He saw in it from the first something rare,
something exceptional, and made wondering inquiries at Rome, where
ecclesiasticism itself scarcely credited the truth of a story which told
"for once clean for the Church and dead against the world, the flesh,
and the devil."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref51" id="fnref51"
href="#fn51">[51]</a></span> The metal which went to the making of the
<i>Ring</i>, and on which he poured his imaginative alloy, was crude and
untempered, but it was gold. Its disintegrated particles gleamed
obscurely, as if with a challenge to the restorative cunning of the
craftsman. Above all, of course, and beyond all else, that arresting
gleam lingered about the bald record of the romance of Pompilia and
Caponsacchi. It was upon these two that Browning's divining imagination
fastened. Their relation was the crucial point of the whole story, the
point at which report stammered most lamely, and where the interpreting
spirit of poetry was most needed "to abolish the death of things, deep
calling unto deep." This process was itself, however, not sudden or
simple. This first inspiration was superb, visionary, romantic,&mdash;in
keeping <a name="page175" id="page175">with</a> "the beauty and
fearfulness of that June night" upon the terrace at Florence, where it
came to him.</p>

It is perhaps not without significance that in the summer sojourn when
<i>The Ring and the Book</i> was planned, Euripides was, apart from
that, his absorbing companion. "I have got on," he writes to Miss

<p class="noindent">Such a vision might have been rendered without
change in the chiselled gold and agate of the <i>Idylls of the King</i>.
But Browning's hero could be no Sir Galahad; he had to be something
less; and also something more. The idealism of his nature had to force
its way through perplexities and errors, beguiled by the distractions
and baffled by the duties of his chosen career. Born to be a lover, in
Dante's great way, he had groped through life without the vision of
Beatrice, seeking to satisfy his blind desire, as perhaps Dante after
Beatrice's death did also, with the lower love and scorning the loveless
asceticism of the monk. The Church encouraged its priest to be "a
fribble and a coxcomb"; and a fribble and a coxcomb, by his own
confession, Caponsacchi became. But the vanities he mingled with never
quite blinded him. He walked in the garden of the Hesperides bent on
great adventure, <a name="page176" id="page176">plucked</a> in ignorance
hedge-fruit and feasted to satiety, but yet he scorned the achievement,
laughing at such high fame for hips and haws.<span class="fnref"><a

flashed upon him the apparition, in the theatre, of</p>

<p class="noindent">The gaze burnt to his soul, and the beautiful, sad,
strange smile haunted him night and day; but their first effect was to
crush and scatter all thoughts of love. The young priest found himself
haunting the solemn shades of the Duomo instead of serenading
countesses; vowed to write no more canzonets, and doubted much whether
Marini were a better poet than Dante after all. His patron jocularly
charged him with playing truant in Church all day long:&mdash;</p>

<p>The forged love-letters he instantly sees through. They are the
scorpion&mdash;blotch feigned to issue miraculously from Madonna's
mouth. And then Pompilia makes her appeal. "Take me to Rome!" The
Madonna has turned her face upon him indeed, "to summon me and signify
her choice," and he at once receives and accepts</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in2">"my own fact, my miracle</span><br />

</div>

<p class="noindent">in the presence of which all hesitation
vanished,&mdash;nay, <a name="page177" id="page177">thought</a> itself
fell back before the tide of revealing emotion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p class="noindent">The bonds of his old existence snapped, the former

life:&mdash;</p>

      As when the virgin-band, the victors chaste,<br />
      Feel at the end the earthly garments drop,<br />
      And rise with something of a rosy shame<br />
      Into immortal nakedness: so I<br />
      Lay, and let come the proper throe would thrill<br />
      Into the ecstasy and outthrob pain."</p>
</div>

<a name="page178" id="page178"></a>
<p class="noindent">But he presently discovered that his new task did
not contravene, but only completed, the old ideal. The Church had
offered her priest no alternative between the world and the
cloister,&mdash;self-indulgence and self-slaughter. For ignoble passion
her sole remedy was to crush passion altogether. She calls to the priest
to renounce the fleshly woman and cleave to Her, the Bride who took his
plighted troth; but it is a scrannel voice sighing from stone lungs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Leave that live passion, come, be dead with me!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From the exalted Pisgah of his "new state" he
recognised that the true self-sacrifice, the perfect priesthood, lay by
way of life, not death, that life and death</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Are means to an end, that passion uses both,<br />
      Indisputably mistress of the man<br />
      Whose form of worship is self-sacrifice."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet it is not this recognition, but the "passion"
which ultimately determines his course. Love is, for Browning, in his
maturity, deeper and more secure than thought; Caponsacchi wavers in his
thinking, falls back upon the narrower conception of priesthood,
persuades himself that his duty is to serve God:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Duty to God is duty to her: I think<br />
      God, who created her, will save her too<br />
      Some new way, by one miracle the more,<br />
      Without me."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But when once again he is confronted with the
strange <a name="page179" id="page179">sad</a> face, and hears once more
the pitiful appeal, all hesitations vanish, and he sees no duty</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Like daring try be good and true myself,<br />
      Leaving the shows of things to the Lord of Show."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With the security of perfect innocence he flings at
his judges as "the final fact"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"In contempt for all misapprehending ignorance<br />
      Of the human heart, much more the mind of Christ,&mdash;<br />
      That I assuredly did bow, was blessed<br />
      By the revelation of Pompilia."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus, through all the psychologic subtlety of the
portrait the groundwork of spiritual romance subsists. The militant
saint of legend reappears, in the mould and garb of the modern world,
subject to all its hampering conditions, and compelled to make his way
over the corpses, not of lions and dragons only, but of consecrated
duties and treasured instincts. And the matter-of-course chivalry of
professed knighthood is as inferior in art as in ethics to the chivalry
to which this priest, vowed to another service, is lifted by the vision
of Pompilia.</p>

<p>Pompilia is herself, like her soldier saint, vowed to another service.
But while he only after a struggle overcomes the apparent discrepancy
between his duty as a priest and as a knight, she rises with the ease
and swiftness of a perfectly pure and spiritual nature from the duty of
endurance to the duty of resistance&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">And she carries the same fearless simplicity into
her love. Caponsacchi falters and recoils in his adorations of her, with
the compunction of the voluptuary turned ascetic; he hardly dares to
call his passion by a name which the vulgar will mumble and
misinterpret: she, utterly unconscious of such peril, glories in the
immeasurable devotion</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Of my one friend, my only, all my own,<br />
      Who put his breast between the spears and me."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Pompilia is steeped in the remembrance of the poet's
"Lyric Love." Remote enough this illiterate child must seem from the
brilliant and accomplished Elizabeth Browning. But Browning's conception
of his wife's nature had a significant affinity to his portrayal of
Pompilia. She, he declared, was "the poet," taught by genius more than
by experience; he himself "the clever person," effectively manipulating
a comprehensive knowledge of life. Pompilia does indeed put her narrow
experience to marvellous use; her blending of the infantine with the
profound touches the bounds of possible consistency; but her naïve
spiritual instinct is ever on the alert, and fills her with a perpetual
sense of the strangeness of the things that happen, a "childlike,
wondering yet subtle perception of the anomalies of life."</p>

<a name="page181" id="page181"></a>
<p>Spiritual simplicity has received no loftier tribute than from the
most opulent and complex poetic intellect of our day. He loves to bring
such natures into contrast with the cunning and cleverness of the world;
to show an Aprile, a David, a Pippa loosening the tangle of more
complicated lives with a song. Pompilia is a sister of the same
spiritual household as these. But she is a far more wonderful creation
than any of them; the same exquisite rarity of soul, but unfolded under
conditions more sternly real, and winning no such miraculous alacrity of
response. In lyrical wealth and swiftness Browning had perhaps advanced
little since the days of Pippa; but how much he had grown in
Shakespearian realism is fairly measured by the contrast between that
early, half-legendary lyric child, by whose unconscious alchemy the hard
hearts of Asolo are suddenly turned, and this later creation, whose
power over her world, though not less real, is so much more slowly and
hardly achieved. Her "song" is only the ravishing "unheard melody" which
breathes like incense from her inarticulate childhood. By simple force
of being what she is, she turns the priest into the saint, compels a
cynical society to believe in spiritual love, and wins even from the
husband who bought her and hated her and slew her the confession of his
last desperate cry&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Pompilia, will you let them murder me?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In contrast with these two, who shape their course
by <a name="page182" id="page182">the</a> light of their own souls, the
authorised exponents of morality play a secondary and for the most part
a sorry part. The old Pope mournfully reflects that his seven years'
tillage of the garden of the Church has issued only in the "timid leaf
and the uncertain bud," while the perfect flower, Pompilia, has sprung
up by the wayside 'neath the foot of the enemy, "a mere chance-sown
seed."</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p class="quote">"Where are the Christians in their panoply?<br />

     Slunk into corners!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Aretine Archbishop, who thrust the suppliant
Pompilia back upon the wolf, the Convent of Convertities, who took her
in as a suffering saint, and after her death claimed her succession
because she was of dishonest life, the unspeakable Abate and Canon,
Guido's brothers,&mdash;it is these figures who have played the most
sinister part, and the old Pope contemplates them with the "terror" of
one who sees his fundamental assumptions shaken at the root. For here
the theory of the Church was hard to maintain. Not only had the Church,
whose mission it was to guide corrupt human nature by its divine light,
only darkened and destroyed, but the saving love and faith had sprung
forth at the bidding of natural promptings of the spirit, which its rule
and law were to supersede.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref55"

<p>It is easy to imagine how so grave an indictment would have been
forced home by the author of the <i>Cenci</i> had this other, less
famous, "Roman murder-case" fallen into his hands. The old Godwinian
virus would have found ready material in this disastrous breakdown of a
great institution, this magnificent uprising of emancipated souls. Yet,
though the Shelleyan affinities of Browning are here visible enough, his
point of view is clearly distinct. The revolutionary animus against
institutions as the sole obstacle to the native goodness of man has
wholly vanished; but of historic or mystic reverence for them he has not
a trace. He parts company with Rousseau without showing the smallest
affinity to Burke. As sources of moral and spiritual growth the State
and the Church do not count. Training and discipline have their relative
worth, but the spirit bloweth where it listeth, and the heights of moral
achievement are won by those alone in whom it breathes the heroism of
aspiration and resolve. His idealists grow for the most part in the
interstices of the social organism. He recognises them, it is true,
without difficulty even in the most central and responsible organs of
government. None of his unofficial heroes&mdash;<a name="page184"
id="page184">Paracelsus</a> or Sordello or Rabbi ben Ezra&mdash;has a
deeper moral insight than the aged Pope. But the Pope's impressiveness
for Browning and for his readers lies just in his complete emancipation
from the bias of his office. He faces the task of judgment, not as an
infallible priest, but as a man, whose wisdom, like other men's, depends
upon the measure of his God-given judgment, and flags with years. His
"grey ultimate decrepitude" is fallible, Pope though he be; and he
naïvely submits the verdict it has framed to the judgment of his former
self, the vigorous, but yet uncrowned, worker in the world. This
summing-up of the case is in effect the poet's own, and
is rich in the familiar prepossessions of Browning's individualist and
unecclesiastical mind. He vindicates Caponsacchi more in the spirit of
an antique Roman than of a Christian; he has open ears for the wisdom of
the pagan world, and toleration for the human Euripides; scorn for the
founder of Jesuitism, sympathy for the heretical Molinists; and he
blesses the imperfect knowledge which makes faith hard. The Pope, like
his creator, is "ever a fighter," and his last word is a peremptory
rejection of all appeals for mercy, whether in the name of policy,
Christian forgiveness, or "soft culture," and a resolve to</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Smite with my whole strength once more, ere end
     my part,<br />
     Ending, so far as man may, this offence."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And with this solemn and final summing-up&mdash;this
quietly authoritative keynote into which all the clashing <a
name="page185" id="page185">discords</a> seem at length to be
resolved&mdash;the poem, in most hands, would have closed. But Browning
was too ingrained a believer in the "oblique" methods of Art to
acquiesce in so simple and direct a conclusion; he loved to let truth
struggle through devious and unlikely channels to the heart instead of
missing its aim by being formally proclaimed or announced. Hence we are
hurried from the austere solitary meditation of the aged Pope to the
condemned cell of Guido, and have opened before us with amazing
swiftness and intensity all the recesses of that monstrous nature, its
"lips unlocked" by "lucidity of soul." It ends, not on a solemn keynote,
but in that passionate and horror-stricken cry where yet lurks the
implicit confession that he is guilty and his doom just&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Pompilia, will you let them murder me?"</p>
</div>

<p>It is easy&mdash;though hardly any longer quite safe&mdash;to cavil
at the unique structure of <i>The Ring and the Book</i>. But this unique
structure, which probably never deterred a reader who had once got under
way, answers in the most exact and expressive way to Browning's aims.
The subject is not the story of Pompilia only, but the fortunes of her
story, and of all stories of spiritual naïvete such as hers, when
projected upon the variously refracting media of mundane judgment and
sympathies. It is not her guilt or innocence only which is on trial, but
the mind of man in its capacity to receive and apprehend the surprises
of the spirit. The issue, triumphant for her, <a name="page186"
id="page186">is</a> dubious and qualified for the mind of man, where the
truth only at last flames forth in its purity. Browning even hints at
the close that "one lesson" to be had from his work is the
falseness of human estimation, fame, and speech. But for the poet who
thus summed up the purport of his twenty thousand verses, this was not
the whole truth of the matter. Here, as always, that immense, even
riotous, vitality of his made the hazards and vicissitudes of the
process even more precious than the secure triumph of the issue, and the
spirit of poetry itself lured him along the devious ways of minds in
which personality set its own picturesque or lurid tinge upon truth. The
execution vindicated the design. Voluble, even "mercilessly voluble,"
the poet of <i>The Ring and the Book</i> undoubtedly is. But it is the
volubility of a consummate master of expression, in whose hands the
difficult medium of blank verse becomes an instrument of Shakespearian
flexibility and compass, easily answering to all the shifts and windings
of a prodigal invention, familiar without being vulgar, gritty with
homely detail without being flat; always, at its lowest levels, touched,
like a plain just before sunrise, with hints of ethereal light,
momentarily withheld; and rising from time to time without effort to a
magnificence of phrase and movement touched in its turn with that
suggestion of the homely and the familiar which in the inmost recesses
of Browning's genius lurked so near&mdash;so vitally near&mdash;to the
roots of the sublime.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The publication of <i>The Ring and the Book</i>
marks in several ways a turning-point in Browning's career. Conceived
and planned before the tragic close of his married life, and written
during the first desolate years of bereavement, it is, more than any
other of his greater poems, pervaded by his wife's spirit, a crowning
monument to his Lyric Love. But it is also the last upon which her
spirit left any notable trace. With his usual extraordinary recuperative
power, Browning re-moulded the mental universe which her love had seemed
to complete, and her death momentarily to shatter, into a new, lesser
completeness. He lived in the world, and frankly "liked earth's way,"
enjoying the new gifts of friendship and of fame which the years brought
in rich measure. The little knot of critics whose praise even of <i>Men
and Women</i> and <i>Dramatis Personæ</i>; had been little more than a
cry in the wilderness, found <a name="page188" id="page188">their</a>
voices lost in the chorus of admiration which welcomed the
story of Pompilia. Some stout recalcitrants, it is true, like Edward
FitzGerald, held their ground. And while the tone of even hostile
criticism became respectful, enough of it remained to provide objects,
seven years later, for the uproarious chaff of <i>Pacchiarotto</i>.</p>

<p>From 1869 to 1871 Browning published nothing, and he appears also to
have written nothing beyond a sonnet commemorating Helen, the mother of
Lord Dufferin (dated April 26, 1870), almost the only set of fourteen
lines in his works of which not one proclaims his authorship. But the
decade which followed was more prolific than any other ten years of his
life. Between 1871 and 1878 nine volumes in swift succession allured,
provoked, or bewildered the reading world. Everything was now planned on
a larger scale; the vast compass and boundless volubility of <i>The Ring
and the Book</i> became normal. He gave free rein to his delight in
intricate involutions of plot and of argument; the dramatic monologue
grew into novels in verse like <i>Red-cotton Night-cap Country</i> and
<i>The Inn Album</i>; and the "special pleaders," Hohenstiel and Juan,
expounded their cases with a complexity of apparatus unapproached even
by Sludge. A certain relaxation of poetic nerve is on the whole
everywhere apparent, notwithstanding the prodigal display of crude
intellectual power. His poetic alchemy is less potent, the ore of sordid
fact remains sordid still. Not that his high spirituality is insecure,
<a name="page189" id="page189">his</a> heroic idealism dimmed; but they
coalesce less intimately with the alert wit and busy intelligence of the
mere "clever man," and seek their nutriment and material more readily in
regions of legend and romance, where the transmuting work of imagination
has been already done. It is no accident that his lifelong delight in
the ideal figures of Greek tragedy, so unlike his own creations, became
in these years for the first time an effective source of poetry. The
poems of this decade form thus an odd motley series&mdash;realism and
romance interlaced but hardly blent, Aeschylus and Euripides, the divine
helper Herakles and the glorious embodiment of the soul of Athens,
Balaustion, emerging and re-emerging after intervals occupied by the
chicaneries of Miranda or the Elder Man. No inept legend for the
Browning of this decade is the noble song of Thamuris which his
Aristophanes half mockingly declaimed. "Earth's poet" and "the heavenly
Muse" are not allies, and they at times go different ways.</p>

<p><i>Hervé Riel</i> (published March 1871) is less characteristic of
Browning in purely literary quality than in the hearty helpfulness which
it celebrates, and the fine international chivalry by which it was
inspired. The French disasters moved him deeply; he had many personal
ties with France, and was sharing with his dearest French friend, Joseph
Milsand, as near neighbour, a primitive villeggiatura in a Norman
fishing-village when the stupendous catastrophe of Sedan broke upon
them. <a name="page190" id="page190">Sympathy</a> with the French
sufferers induced Browning to do violence to a cherished principle by
offering the poem to George Smith for publication in <i>The
Cornhill</i>. Most of its French readers doubtless heard of Hervé Riel,
as well as of Robert Browning, for the first time. His English readers
found it hard to classify among the naval ballads of their country, few
of which had been devoted to celebrating the exploits of foreign
sailors, or the deliverance of hostile fleets. But they recognised the
poet of <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, Hervé has no touch of
Browning's "philosophy." He is none the less a true kinsman, in his
homely fashion, of Caponsacchi,&mdash;summoned in a supreme emergency for
which the appointed authorities have proved unequal.</p>

<p>A greater tale of heroic helpfulness was presently to engage him.
<i>Balaustion's Adventure</i> was, as the charming dedication tells us,
the most delightful of May-month amusements; but in the splendid proem
which enshrines the story of Herakles and Alkestis, we still feel the
thrill of the deadly conflict; the agony of France may be partly divined
in the agony of Athens. Thirty years before, he had shown, in the noble
fragmentary "prologue" to a <i>Hippolytus (Artemis Prologizes)</i>, a
command of the majestic, reticent manner of Greek tragedy sufficiently
remarkable in one whose natural instincts of expression were far more
Elizabethan than Greek. The incongruity of Greek dramatic methods with
his own <a name="page191" id="page191">seems</a> to have speedily
checked his progress; but Euripides, the author of the Greek
<i>Hippolytus</i>, retained a peculiar fascination for
him, and it was on another Euripidean drama that he now, in the fulness
of his powers, set his hand. The result certainly does not diminish our
sense of the incongruity. Keenly as he admired the humanity and pathos
of Euripides, he challenges comparison with Euripides most successfully
when he goes completely his own way. He was too robustly original to
"transcribe" well, and his bold emphatic speech, curbed to the task of
reproducing the choice and pregnant sobriety of Attic style, is apt to
eliminate everything but the sobriety. The "transcribed" Greek is often
yet flatter than "literal" versions of Greek verse are wont to be, and
when Browning speaks in his own person the style recovers itself with a
sudden and vehement bound, like a noble wild creature abruptly released
from restraint. Among the finest of these "recoveries" are the bursts of
description which Balaustion's enthusiasm interjects between the
passages of dialogue. Such is the magnificent picture of the coming of
Herakles. In the original he merely enters as the chorus end their song,
addressing them with the simple inquiry, "Friends, is Admetos haply
within?" to which the chorus reply, like civil retainers, "Yes,
Herakles, he is at home." Browning, or his Balaustion, cannot permit the
mighty undoer of the tragic harms to come on in this homely fashion. A
great interrupting voice rings suddenly <a name="page192"
id="page192">through</a> the dispirited maunderings of Admetos'
house-folk; and the hearty greeting, "My hosts here!" thrills them with
the sense that something good and opportune is at hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Sudden into the midst of sorrow leapt,<br />
      Along with the gay cheer of that great voice<br />
      Hope, joy, salvation: Herakles was here!<br />
      Himself o' the threshold, sent his voice on first<br />
      To herald all that human and divine<br />
      I' the weary, happy face of him,&mdash;half god,<br />
      Half man, which made the god-part god the more."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The heroic helpfulness of Herakles is no doubt the
chief thing for Browning in the story. The large gladness of spirit with
which he confronts the meticulous and perfunctory mourning of the
stricken household reflected his own habitual temper with peculiar
vividness. But it is clear that the Euripidean story contained an
element which Browning could not assimilate&mdash;Admetos' acceptance of
Alkestis' sacrifice. To the Greek the action seemed quite in order; the
persons who really incurred his reproof were Admetos' parents, who in
spite of their advanced years refused to anticipate their approaching
death in their son's favour. Browning cannot away with an Admetos who,
from sheer reluctance to die, allowed his wife to suffer death in his
place; and he characteristically suggests a version of the story in
which its issues are determined from first to last, and on both sides, by
self-sacrificing love. Admetos is now the large-minded king who grieves
to be called away before <a name="page193" id="page193">his</a> work for
his people is done. Alkestis seeks, with Apollo's leave, to take his
place, so that her lord may live and carry out the purposes of his
soul,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Nor let Zeus lose the monarch meant in thee."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But Admetos will not allow this; for Alkestis is as
spirit to his flesh, and his life without her would be but a passive
death. To which "pile of truth on truth" she rejoins by adding the "one
truth more," that his refusal of her sacrifice would be in effect a
surrender of the supreme duty laid upon him of reigning a righteous
king,&mdash;that this life-purpose of his is above joy and sorrow, and
the death which she will undergo for his and its sake, her highest good
as it is his. And in effect, her death, instead of paralysing him,
redoubles the vigour of his soul, so that Alkestis, living on in a mind
made better by her presence, has not in the old tragic sense died at
all, and finds her claim to enter Hades rudely rejected by "the pensive
queen o' the twilight," for whom death meant just to die, and wanders
back accordingly to live once more by Admetos' side. Such the story
became when the Greek dread of death was replaced by Browning's
spiritual conception of a death glorified by love. The pathos and tragic
forces of it were inevitably enfeebled; no Herakles was needed to pluck
this Alkestis from the death she sought, and the rejection of her claim
to die is perilously near to Lucianic burlesque. But, simply as poetry,
the joyous sun-like <a name="page194" id="page194">radiance</a> of the
mighty spoiler of death is not unworthily replaced by the twilight
queen, whose eyes</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in5">"lingered still</span><br />
      Straying among the flowers of Sicily,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">absorbed in the far memory of the life that Herakles
asserted and enforced,&mdash;until, at Alkestis' summons, she</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in2">"broke through humanity</span><br />
      Into the orbed omniscience of a god."</p>
</div>

<p>From his idealised Admetos Browning passed with hardly a pause to
attempt the more difficult feat of idealising a living sovereign.
Admetos was ennobled by presenting him as a political idealist; the
French Emperor, whose career had closed at Sedan, was in some degree
qualified for a parallel operation by the obscurity which still invested
the inmost nature of that well-meaning adventurer. Browning had watched
Louis Napoleon's career with mixed feelings; he had resented the <i>coup
d'état</i>, and still more the annexation of Savoy and Nice after the war
of 1859. But he had never shared the bitter animus which prevailed at
home. He was equally far, no doubt, from sharing the exalted
hero-worship which inspired his wife's <i>Poems before Congress</i>. The
creator of <i>The Italian in England</i>, of Luigi, and Bluphocks, could
not but recognise the signal services of Napoleon to the cause of Italian
freedom, however sharply he condemned the hard terms on which Italy had
been compelled to purchase it. "It was a great action; but he has taken
eighteenpence <a name="page195" id="page195">for</a> it&mdash;which is a
pity";<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref57" id="fnref57"
href="#fn57">[57]</a></span> it was on the lines of this
epigram, already quoted, that eleven years later he still interpreted
the fallen emperor, and that he now completed, as it would seem, the
abandoned poem of 1860. He saw in him a man of generous impulses doubled
with a <i>borné</i> politician, a ruler of genuine Liberal and even
democratic proclivities, which the timid calculations of a second-rate
opportunist reduced to a contemptible travesty of Liberalism. The
shifting standpoints of such a man are reproduced with superfluous
fidelity in his supposed Defence, which seems designed to be as elusive
and impalpable as the character it reflects. How unlike the brilliant
and precise realism of Blougram, sixteen years before! The upcurling
cloud-rings from Hohenstiel's cigar seem to symbolise something
unsubstantial and evasive in the whole fabric. The assumptions we are
invited to form give way one after another. Leicester Square proves the
"Residenz," the "bud-mouthed arbitress" a shadowy memory, the discourse
to a friendly and flattered hearer a midnight meditation. And there is a
like fluctuation of mood. Now he is formally justifying his past, now
musing, half wistfully, half ironically, over all that he might have
been and was not. At the outset we see him complacently enough
intrenched within a strong position, that of the consistent opportunist,
who made the best of what he found, not a creator but a conservator,
"one who keeps the world safe." But he has ardent ideas and
aspirations. <a name="page196" id="page196">The</a> freedom of Italy has
kindled his imagination, and in the grandest passage of the poem he
broods over his frustrate but deathless dream:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Ay, still my fragments wander, music-fraught,<br />
      Sighs of the soul, mine once, mine now, and mine<br />
      For ever! Crumbled arch, crushed aqueduct,<br />
      Alive with tremors in the shaggy growth<br />
      Of wild-wood, crevice-sown, that triumphs there,<br />
      Imparting exultation to the hills."</p>

<i>Letters of E.B.B.</i>, ii. 385.
</div>

<p class="noindent">But if he had abandoned these generous dreams, he
had won free trade and given the multitude cheap bread, and in a highly
ingenious piece of sophistry he explains, by the aid of the gospel of
Evolution, how men are united by their common hunger, and thrust apart
by their conflicting ideas. But Hohenstiel knows very well that his
intrenchments are not unassailable; and he goes on to compose an
imaginary biography of himself as he might have been, with comments
which reflect his actual course. The finest part of this æthereal voyage
is that in which his higher unfulfilled self pours scorn upon the paltry
duplicities of the "Peace" policy by which his actual and lower self had
kept on good terms abroad, and beguiled the imperious thirst for "la
gloire" at home. Indignantly the author of <i>Hervé Riel</i> asks why
"the more than all magnetic race" should have to court its rivals by
buying their goods untaxed, or guard against them by war for war's sake,
when Mother Earth has no pride above her pride in that same</p>

      Urged by a pinion all too passionate<br />
      For heaven and what it holds of gloom and glow."</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Ring and the Book</i> had made Browning famous. But fame was
far from tempting him to undue compliance with the tastes of his new-won
public; rather it prompted him to indulge his genius more freely, and to
go his own way with a more complete security and unconcern.
<i>Hohenstiel-Schwangau</i>&mdash;one of the rockiest and least
attractive of all Browning's poems&mdash;had mystified most of its
readers and been little relished by the rest. And now that plea for a
discredited politician was followed up by what, on the face of it, was,
as Mrs Orr puts it, "a defence of inconstancy in marriage." The
apologist for Napoleon III. came forward as the advocate of Don Juan.
The prefixed bit of dialogue from Molière's play explains the situation.
Juan, detected by his wife in an intrigue, is completely nonplussed.
"Fie!" cries Elvire, mockingly (in Browning's happy paraphrase),&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Fie! for a man of mode, accustomed at the court<br />
      To such a style of thing, how awkwardly my lord<br />
      Attempts defence!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this emergency, Browning, as it would seem, steps
in, and provides the arch-voluptuary with a philosophy of illicit love,
quite beyond the speculative capacity of <a name="page198"
id="page198">any</a> Juan in literature, and glowing with poetry
of a splendour and fertility which neither Browning himself nor the
great English poet who had identified his name with that of Juan, and
whom Browning in this very poem overwhelms with genial banter, ever
surpassed. The poem inevitably challenged comparison with Byron's
masterpiece. In dazzling play of intellect, in swift interchange of wit
and passion, the English nineteenth century produced nothing more
comparable to the <i>Don Juan</i> of Byron than <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that the critics had some excuse who, like
Mortimer, frankly identified Browning with his hero, and described the
poem as an assertion of the "claim to relieve the fixity of conjugal
affection by varied adventure in the world of temporary loves."<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref58" id="fnref58"
href="#fn58">[58]</a></span> For Browning has not merely given no direct
hint of his own divergence from Juan, corresponding to his significant
comment upon Blougram&mdash;"he said true things but called them by
false names"; he has made his own subtlest and profoundest convictions
on life and art spring spontaneously from the brain of this brilliant
conqueror of women. Like Goethe's Faust, he unmistakably shares the
mind, the wisdom, the faith, of his creator; it is plausible to suppose
that the poet indorses his application of them. This is unquestionably a
complete mistake; but Browning, as usual, presumed too much upon his
readers' <a name="page199" id="page199">insight</a>, and took no pains to
obviate a confusion which he clearly supposed to be impossible.</p>

curiously indecisive and embarrassed.
</div>

<p>It was on the strand at Pornic that he encountered the fateful gipsy
whom he calls Fifine. Arnold, years before, had read unutterable depths
of soul in another gipsy child by another shore. For Browning now, as in
the days of the <i>Flight of the Duchess</i>, the gipsy symbolised the
life of joyous detachment from the constraints of society and
civilisation. The elementary mood, out of which the wondrous woof of
reasonings and images is evolved, is simply the instinctive beat of the
spirit of romance in us all, in sympathy with these light-hearted losels
of the wild, who "cast allegiance off, play truant, nor repine," and
though disgraced but seem to relish life the more.</p>

<p>The beautiful <i>Prologue</i>&mdash;one of the most original lyrics
in the language&mdash;strikes the keynote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Sometimes, when the weather<br />
     <span class="in1">Is blue, and warm waves tempt</span><br />
      To free oneself of tether,<br />
     <span class="in1">And try a life exempt</span></p>

     <p class="noindent">From worldly noise and dust,<br />
     <span class="in1">In the sphere which overbrims</span><br />
      With passion and thought,&mdash;why, just<br />
     <span class="in1">Unable to fly, one swims....</span></p>

     <p class="noindent">Emancipate through passion<br />
     <span class="in1">And thought,&mdash;with sea for sky,</span><br />
      We substitute, in a fashion,<br />
     <span class="in1">For heaven&mdash;poetry."</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is this "emancipation" from our confinement in
<a name="page200" id="page200">the</a> bonds of prose, commonplace, and
routine, by a passion and thought-winged imagination, which is the true
subject of the poem. But he chooses to convey his meaning, as usual,
through the rich refracting medium of dramatic characters and situations
quite unlike his own. So his "apology for poetry" becomes an item in Don
Juan's case for the "poetry" of dalliance with light-o'-loves. Fifine
herself acquires new importance; the emancipated gipsy turns into the
pert seductive coquette, while over against her rises the pathetic
shadow of the "wife in trouble," her white fingers pressing Juan's arm,
"ravishingly pure" in her "pale constraint." Between these three persons
the moving drama is played out, ending, like all Don Juan stories, with
the triumph of the baser influence. Elvire, with her eloquent silences
and wistful pathos, is an exquisite creation,&mdash;a wedded sister of
Shakespeare's Hero; Fifine, too, with her strutting bravado and "pose
half frank, half fierce," shrills her discordant note vivaciously
enough. The principal speaker himself is the most complex of Browning's
casuists, a marvellously rich and many-hued piece of portraiture. This
Juan is deeply versed in all the activities of the imagination which he
so eloquently defends. Painting and poetry, science and philosophy, are
at his command; above all, he is an artist and a poet in the lore of
Love.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the kind of adventure on which Juan claims the
right of projecting his imagination has close affinities with the
habitual procedure of Browning's <a name="page201" id="page201">own</a>.
Juan defends his dealings with the gay fizgig Fifine as a step to the
fuller appreciation of Elvire; he demands freedom to escape only as a
means of possessing more surely and intimately what he has. And
Browning's "emancipation" is not that of the purely Romantic poet, who
pursues a visionary abstraction remote from all his visible environment.
The emancipated soul, for him, was rather that which incessantly
"practised with" its environment, fighting its way through countless
intervening films of illusion to the full knowledge of itself and of all
that it originally held <i>in posse</i>. This might not be an adequate
account of his own artistic processes, in which genial instinct played a
larger, and resolute will a smaller, part than his invincible
athleticism of temperament would suggest. But his marvellous wealth of
spontaneous vision was fed and enriched by incessant "practice with" his
environment; his idealism was vitalised by the ceaseless play of eye and
brain upon the least promising mortal integuments of spirit; he
possessed "Elvire" the more securely for having sent forth his
adventurous imagination to practise upon innumerable Fifines.</p>

<p>The poem itself&mdash;as a defence of his poetic methods&mdash;was an
"adventure" in which imagination played an unusually splendid part. A
succession of brilliant and original images, visions, similes, parables,
exhibits the twofold nature of the "stuff" with which the artist
plays,&mdash;its inferiority, its poverty, its "falseness" in itself,
its needfulness, its potency, its worth for him. <a name="page202"
id="page202">It</a> is the water which supports the swimmer, but in
which he cannot live; the dross of straw and chaff which
yields the brilliant purity of flame (c. 55); the technical cluster of
sounds from which issues "music&mdash;that burst of pillared cloud by
day and pillared fire by night" (c. 41). The whole poem is haunted by
the sense of dissonance which these images suggest between the real and
the apparent meaning of things. Browning's world, else so massive and so
indubitable, becomes unsubstantial and phantasmal, an illusive pageant
in which Truth is present only under a mask, being "forced to manifest
itself through falsehood." Juan, who declares that, unlike poets, "we
prose-folk" always dream, has, in effect, a visionary quality of
imagination which suits his thesis and his theme. The "dream figures" of
the famous ladies pass before us like a gorgeous tapestry,&mdash;some
rich Venetian rendering of a medieval <i>ballade du temps jadis</i>;
then Venice itself opens before us, all moving life and colour, under the
enchantment of Schumann's <i>Carnival</i>, only to resolve itself into a
vaster pageant of the world, with its mighty fanes of art and science,
which, seemingly "fixed as fate, not fairy-work," yet</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in9">"tremblingly grew blank</span><br />
      From bright, then broke afresh in triumph,&mdash;ah, but sank<br />

</div>

<p>The August of 1872 found Browning and his sister once more in France.
This time, however, not at <a name="page203" id="page203">Croisic</a>
but Saint Aubin&mdash;the primitive hamlet on the Norman coast to which
he had again been drawn by his attachment to Joseph Milsand. At a
neighbouring village was another old friend, Miss Thackeray, who has
left a charming account of the place. They walked along a narrow
cliff-path: "The sea-coast far below our feet, the dried, arid
vegetation of the sandy way, the rank yellow snapdragon lining the
paths.... We entered the Brownings' house. The sitting-room door opened
to the garden and the sea beyond&mdash;a fresh-swept bare floor, a
table, three straw chairs, one book upon the table." A misunderstanding,
now through the good offices of Milsand happily removed, had clouded the
friendship of Browning and Miss Thackeray; and his joyous revulsion of
heart has left characteristic traces in the poem which he dedicated to
his "fair friend." The very title is jest&mdash;an outflow of high
spirits in an exuberantly hearty hand-shake&mdash;"British
man with British maid"; the country of the "Red-cotton Night-cap" being
in fact, of course, the country which her playful realism had already
nicknamed "White-cotton Night-cap Country," from the white lawn
head-dress of the Norman women. Nothing so typical and everyday could
set Browning's imagination astir, and among the wilderness of white,
innocent and flavourless, he caught at a story which promised to be
"wrong and red and picturesque," and vary "by a splotch the righteous
flat of insipidity."</p>

<a name="page204" id="page204"></a>
<p>The story of Miranda the Paris jeweller and his mistress, Clara de
Millefleurs, satisfied this condition sufficiently. Time had not
mellowed the raw crudity of this "splotch," which Browning found
recorded in no old, square, yellow vellum book, but in the French
newspapers of that very August; the final judgment of the court at Caen
("Vire") being actually pronounced while he wrote. The poet followed on
the heels of the journalist, and borrowed, it must be owned, not a
little of his methods. If any poem of Browning's may be compared to
versified special correspondence, it is this. He tells the story, in his
own person, in blank verse of admirable ease and fluency, from which
every pretence of poetry is usually remote. What was it in this rather
sordid tale that arrested him? Clearly the strangely mingled character
of Miranda. Castile and Paris contend in his blood; and his love
adventures, begun on the boulevards and in their spirit, end in an
ecstasy of fantastic devotion. His sins are commonplace and prosaic
enough, but his repentances detach him altogether from the herd of
ordinary penitents as well as of ordinary sinners&mdash;confused and
violent gesticulations of a visionary ascetic struggling to liberate
himself from the bonds of his own impurity. "The heart was wise
according to its lights"; but the head was incapable of shaping this
vague heart-wisdom into coherent practice. A parallel piece of analysis
presents Clara as a finished artist in life&mdash;a Meissonier of
limited but flawless perfection in her unerring <a name="page205"
id="page205">selection</a> of means to ends. In other words, this not
very attractive pair struck Browning as another example of his familiar
contrast between those who "try the low thing and leave it done," and
those who aim higher and fail. Yet it must be owned that these
Browningesque ideas are not thoroughly wrought into the substance of the
poem; they are rather a sort of marginal embroidery woven on to a story
which, as a whole, has neither been shaped by Browning's hand nor
vitalised with his breath. Neither Clara nor Miranda can be compared in
dramatic force with his great creations; even Clara's harangue to the
Cousinry, with all its passion and flashing scorn, is true rather to her
generic character as the injured champion of her dead lord than to her
individual variety of it&mdash;the woman of subtle, inflexible, yet
calculating devotion. Miranda's soliloquy before he throws himself from
the Tower is a powerful piece of construction, but, when the book is
closed, what we seem to see in it is not the fantastical goldsmith
surveying the motives of his life, but Browning filling in the bizarre
outlines of his construction with appropriate psychological detail.
Another symptom of decline in Browning's most characteristic kind of
power is probably to be found in the play of symbolism which invests
with an air of allegorical abstraction the "Tower" and the "Turf," and
makes the whole poem, with all its prosaic realism, intelligibly
regarded as a sort of fantasia on self-indulgence and self-control.</p>

<a name="page206" id="page206"></a>
<p>The summer retreat of 1874 was found once more on the familiar north
coast of France,&mdash;this time at the quiet hamlet of Mers, near
Treport. In this lonely place, with scarcely a book at hand, he wrote
the greater part of the most prodigally and exuberantly learned of all
his poems&mdash;<i>Aristophanes' Apology</i> (published April 1875). It
was not Browning's way to repeat his characters, but the story of
Balaustion, the brilliant girl devotee of Euripides, had proved an
admirable setting for his interpretations of Greek drama; and the charm
of that earlier "most delightful of May-month amusements" was perhaps
not the less easily revived in these weeks of constant companionship
with a devoted woman-friend of his own. Balaustion is herself full ten
years older than at the time of her first adventure; her fresh girlish
enthusiasm has ripened into the ardent conviction of intellectual
maturity; she can not only cite Euripides, but vindicate his art against
his mightiest assailant. Situation, scenery, language, are here all more
complex. The first Adventure was almost Greek in its radiant and moving
simplicity; the last is Titanically Browningesque, a riot of the least
Hellenic elements of Browning's mind with the uptorn fragments of the
Hellenic world. Moreover, the issue is far from being equally clear. The
glory of Euripides is still the ostensible theme; but Aristophanes had
so many points of contact with Browning himself, and appeals in his
defence to so many root-ideas of Browning's <a name="page207"
id="page207">own</a>, that the reader hesitates between
the poet to whom Browning's imagination allied him, and the poet whom
his taste preferred. His Aristophanes is, like himself, the poetry of
"Life," a broad and generous realist, who like Lippo Lippi draws all
existence into his art; an enemy of all asceticisms and abstractions,
who drives his meaning home through vivid concrete example and drastic
phrase, rather than by enunciating the impressive moral commonplaces of
tragic poetry.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref59" id="fnref59"
href="#fn59">[59]</a></span> Aristophanes, too, had been abused for his
"unintelligible" poetry,&mdash;"mere psychologic puzzling,"<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref60" id="fnref60" href="#fn60">[60]</a></span>&mdash;by a
"chattering" public which preferred the lilt of nursery rhymes. The
magnificent portrait of Aristophanes is conceived in the very spirit of
the riotous exuberance of intellect and senses&mdash;</p>

<p>Balaustion is herself the first to recognise the divinity shrouded in
this half satyr-like form: in some of the <a name="page208"
id="page208">finest</a> verses of the poem she compares him to the
sea-god, whom as a child she had once seen peer</p>

      A sea-worn face, sad as mortality,<br />
      Divine with yearning after fellowship,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">while below the surface all was "tail splash, frisk of fin." And when
Balaustion has recited her poet's masterpiece of tragic pathos,
Aristophanes lays aside the satirist a moment and attests his affinity
to the divine poets by the noble song of Thamyris. The "transcript from
Euripides" itself is quite secondary in interest to this vivid and
powerful dramatic framework. Far from being a vital element in the
action, like the recital of the <i>Alkestis</i>, the reading of the
<i>Hercules Furens</i> is an almost gratuitous diversion in the midst of
the talk; and the tameness of a literal (often awkwardly literal)
translation is rarely broken by those inrushes of alien genius which are
the glory of Browning's <i>Alkestis</i>. Yet the very self-restraint
sprang probably from Browning's deep sensibility to the pathos of the
story. "Large tears," as Mrs Orr has told us, fell from his eyes, and
emotion choked his voice, when he first read it aloud to her.</p>

<p>The <i>Inn Album</i> is, like <i>Red-cotton Night-cap Country</i>, a
versified novel, melodramatic in circumstances, frankly familiar in
scenery and atmosphere. Once more, as in the <i>Blot in the
'Scutcheon</i>, and in <i>James Lee's Wife</i>, Browning turned for his
"incidents in the development <a name="page209" id="page209">of</a>
souls" to the passion and sin-frayed lives of his own countrymen. But no
halo of seventeenth-century romance here tempers the sordid modernity of
the facts; the "James Lee" of this tragedy appears in person and is
drawn with remorseless insistence on every mean detail which announces
the "rag-and-feather hero-sham." Everything except his wit and eloquence
is sham and shabby in this Club-and-Country-house villain, who violates
more signally than any figure in poetic literature the canon that the
contriver of the tragic harms must not be totally despicable. A thief,
as Schiller said, can qualify for a tragic hero only by adding to his
theft the more heroic crime of murder; but Browning's Elder Man
compromises even the professional perfidies of a Don Juan with shady
dealings at cards and the like which Don Juan himself would have
scouted. In <i>Fifine</i> the Don Juan of tradition was lifted up into
and haloed about with poetical splendours not his own; here he is
depressed into an equally alien sorriness of prose. But the decisive and
commanding figure, for Browning and for his readers, is of course his
victim and Nemesis, the Elder Lady. She is as unlike Pompilia as he is
unlike Guido; but we see not less clearly how the upleaping of the soul
of womanhood in the child, under the stress of foul and cruel wrongs,
has once more asserted its power over him. And if Pompilia often recalls
his wife, the situation of the Elder Lady may fairly remind us of that
of Marion Erle in <i>Aurora Leigh</i>. But many complexities in the
working <a name="page210" id="page210">out</a> mark Browning's design.
The betrayed girl, scornfully refusing her betrayer's tardy offer of
marriage, has sought a refuge, as the wife of a clergyman, in the
drudgery of a benighted parish. The chance meeting of the two, four
years after, in the inn parlour, their bitter confessions, through the
veil of mutual hatred, that life has been ruined for both,&mdash;he,
with his scandalous successes growing at last notorious, she, the soul
which once "sprang at love," now sealed deliberately against beauty, and
spent in preaching monstrous doctrines which neither they nor their
savage parishioners believe nor observe,&mdash;all this is imagined very
powerfully and on lines which would hardly have occurred to any one else.</p>

<p>The <i>Pacchiarotto</i> volume forms a kind of epilogue to the work
of the previous half-dozen years. Since <i>The Ring and the Book</i> he
had become a famous personage; his successive poems had been everywhere
reviewed at length; a large public was genuinely interested in him,
while a yet larger complained of his "obscurity," but did not venture to
ignore him, and gossiped eagerly about his private life. He himself,
mingling freely, an ever-welcome guest, in the choicest London society,
had the air of having accepted the world as cordially as it on the whole
accepted him. Yet barriers remained. Poems like the <i>Red-cotton
Night-cap Country</i>, the <i>Inn Album</i>, and <i>Fifine</i> had
alienated many whom <i>The Ring and the Book</i> had won captive, and
embarrassed the defence of some <a name="page211" id="page211">of</a>
Browning's staunchest devotees. Nobody knew better than the popular
diner-out, Robert Browning, how few of the men and women who listened to
his brilliant talk had any grip upon his inner mind; and he did little
to assist their insight. The most affable and accessible of men up to a
certain point, he still held himself, in the deeper matters of his art,
serenely and securely aloof. But it was a good-humoured, not a cynical,
aloofness, which found quite natural expression in a volley of genial
chaff at the critics who thought themselves competent to teach him his
business. This is the main, at least the most dominant, note of
<i>Pacchiarotto</i>. It is like an aftermath of <i>Aristophanes'
Apology</i>. But the English poet scarcely deigns to defend his art. No
beautiful and brilliant woman is there to put him on his mettle and call
out his chivalry. The mass of his critics are roundly made game of, in a
boisterously genial sally, as "sweeps" officiously concerned at his
excess of "smoke." <i>Pacchiarotto</i> is a whimsical tale of a poor
painter who came to grief in a Quixotic effort to "reform" his fellows.
Rhyme was never more brilliantly abused than in this <i>tour de
force</i>, in which the clang of the machinery comes near to
killing the music. More seriously, in the finely turned stanzas <i>At the
Mermaid</i>, and <i>House</i>, he avails himself of the habitual
reticence of Shakespeare to defend by implication his own reserve, not
without a passing sarcasm at the cost of the poet who took Europe by
storm <a name="page212" id="page212">with</a> the pageant of his broken
heart. <i>House</i> is for the most part rank prose, but it sums up
incisively in the well-known retort:</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in12">"'<i>With this same key</i></span><br />
      <i>Shakespeare unlocked his heart</i>,' once more!<br />
      <span class="in1">Did Shakespeare? If so, the less Shakespeare he!"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This "house" image is singularly frequent in this
volume. The poet seems haunted by the idea of the barrier walls, which
keep off the public gaze, but admit the privileged spirit. In <i>Fears
and Scruples</i> it symbolises the reticence of God. In
<i>Appearances</i> the "poor room" in which troth was plighted and the
"rich room" in which "the other word was spoken" become half human in
sympathy. A woman's "natural magic" makes the bare walls she dwells in a
"fairy tale" of verdure and song. The prologue seems deliberately to
strike this note, with its exquisite idealisation of the old red brick
wall and its creepers lush and lithe,&mdash;a formidable barrier indeed,
but one which spirit and love can pass. For here the "wall" is the
unsympathetic throng who close the poet in; there</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"I&mdash;prison-bird, with a ruddy strife<br />
     <span class="in1">At breast, and a life whence storm-notes start&mdash;</span><br />
      Hold on, hope hard in the subtle thing<br />
     <span class="in1">That's spirit: though cloistered fast, soar free;</span><br />
      Account as wood, brick, stone, this ring<br />
     <span class="in1">Of the rueful neighbours, and&mdash;forth to thee!"</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These stanzas finely hint at a second theme which
wanders in and out among the strident notes of Browning's anti-critical
"apologetics." Of all the <a name="page213" id="page213">springs</a> of
poetry none lay deeper in Browning than love; to the last he could sing
of love with the full inspiration of his best time; and the finest
things in this volume are concerned with it. But as compared with the
love-lays of the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i> or <i>Men and Women</i>
there is something wistful, far off, even elegiac, in this love-poetry.
A barrier, undefinable but impassable, seems to part us from the full
tide of youthful passion. The richest in this tender sunset beauty is
the <i>St Martin's Summer</i>, where the late love is suddenly smitten
with the discovery that its apparent warmth is a ghost of old passion
buried but unallayed. Again and again Browning here dwells upon the
magic of love,&mdash;as if love still retained for the ageing poet an
isolated and exceptional irradiating power in a world fast fading into
commonplace and prose. The brief, exquisite snatches of song, <i>Natural
Magic, Magical Nature</i>, are joyous tributes to the power of the
charm, paid by one who remains master of his heart. <i>Numpholeptos</i>
is the long-drawn enchanted reverie of one in the very toils of the
spell&mdash;a thing woven of dreams and emotions, dark-glowing,
iridescent to the eye, languorous to the ear, impalpable to the analytic
intellect. In <i>Bifurcation</i> he puts again, with more of subtlety
and of detachment, the problem of the conventional conflict of love with
duty, so peremptorily decided in love's favour in <i>The Statue and the
Bust</i>. <i>A Forgiveness</i> is a powerful reworking of the theme of
<i>My Last Duchess</i>, with an added irony of situation: <a
name="page214" id="page214">Browning</a>, who excels in the drama of
silent figures, has drawn none more effective than this guilty priest,
who grinds his teeth behind the confessional grating as he listens
perforce to the story of his own crime from the lips of the wronged
husband, still cherishing the hope that he is unrecognised, or at the
worst may elude vengeance in his cloister's solitude; until the
avenger's last words throw off the mask:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Hardly, I think! As little helped his brow<br />
      The cloak then, Father&mdash;as your grate helps now!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From these high matters of passion and tragedy we
pass by easy steps into the jocular-colloquial region in which the
volume opened. Painting in these later days of Browning's has ceased to
yield high, or even serious poetry, and Baldinucci's tale of shabby
trickery cannot be compared, even for grotesque humour, with the
powerful grotesquerie of <i>Holy-Cross Day</i>, while it wholly lacks
the great lift of Hebraic sublimity at the close. The <i>Epilogue</i>
returns to the combative apologetics of the title poem; but, unlike
that, does attempt some reply to the cavils of the discontented. They
cannot have the strong and the sweet&mdash;body and bouquet&mdash;at
once, he tells them in effect, and he chooses to be strong, to give the
good grape and leave the cowslips growing in the meadow. The argument
was but another sally of the poet's good-humoured chaff, and would not
have stood the scrutiny of his subtler mind. Doubtless he, like Ben
Jonson, inclined to see signs of the "strong" in the astringent <a
name="page215" id="page215">and</a> the gritty; but no one knew better,
when he chose, to wed his "strength" with "sweetness." The falling-off
of the present volume compared with <i>Men and Women</i> or <i>Dramatis
Personæ</i> lay less in the lack of either quality than in his failure
to bring them together. Of the "stiff brew" there is plenty; but the
choicest aroma comes from that "wine of memories"&mdash;the fragrant
reminiscences&mdash;which the poet affected to despise. The epilogue
ends, incorrigibly, with a promise to "posset and cosset" the cavilling
reader henceforward with "nettle-broth," good for the sluggish blood and
the disordered stomach.</p>

<p>The following year brought a production which the cavilling reader
might excusably regard as a fulfilment of this jocose threat. For the
translation of the <i>Agamemnon</i> (1877) was not in any sense a
serious contribution to the English knowledge and love of Greek drama.
The Balaustion "transcripts" had betrayed an imperfect sensibility to
the finer qualities of Greek dramatic style. But Browning seems to have
gone to work upon the greatest of antique tragedies with the definite
intention of showing, by a version of literal fidelity, how little the
Greek drama at its best owed to Greek speech. And he has little
difficulty in making the oracular brevity of Aeschylus look bald, and
his sublime incoherences frigid.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref61"
id="fnref61" href="#fn61">[61]</a></span> The result is, <a
name="page216" id="page216">nevertheless</a>, very interesting and
instructive to the student of Browning's mind. Nowhere
else do we feel so acutely how foreign to his versatile and athletic
intellect was the primitive and elemental imagination which interprets
the heart and the conscience of nations. His acute individualism in
effect betrayed him, and made his too faithful translation resemble a
parody of this mighty fragment of the mind of Themistoclean Athens by
one of the brilliant irresponsible Sophists of the next generation.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn61" id="fn61" href="#fnref61">[61]</a></span>
It is hard to explain how Browning came also to choose his
restless hendecasyllables as a medium for the stately iambic of
Æschylus. It is more like Fletcher outdoing himself in double endings.
</div>

<p>The spring and summer of 1877 were not productive. The summer holiday
was spent in a new haunt among the Savoy Alps, and Browning missed the
familiar stimulus of the sea-air. But the early autumn brought an event
which abruptly shattered his quiescence, and called forth, presently,
the most intimately personal poem of his later years. Miss Ann
Egerton-Smith, his gifted and congenial companion at London concerts,
and now, for the fourth year in succession, in the summer
<i>villeggiatura</i>, died suddenly of heart disease at dawn on Sept.
14, as she was preparing for a mountain expedition with her friends. It
was not one of those losses which stifle thought or sweep it along on
the vehement tide of lyric utterance; it was rather of the kind which
set it free, creating an atmosphere of luminous serenity about it, and
allaying all meaner allurements and distractions. Elegy is often the
outcome of such moods; and the elegiac note is perceptible in the grave
music of <i>La Saisiaz</i>. Yet the poem as a <a name="page217"
id="page217">whole</a> does not even distantly recall,
save in the quiet intensity of its ground tone, the noble poems in which
Milton or Shelley, Arnold or Tennyson, commemorated their dead friends.
He himself commemorated no other dead friend in a way like this; to his
wife's memory he had given only the sacred silence, the impassioned
hymn, the wealth of poetry inspired by her spirit but not addressed to
her. This poem, also, was written "once, and only once, and for one
only." <i>La Saisiaz</i> recalls to us, perversely perhaps, poems of
his in which no personal sorrow beats. The glory of the dawn and the
mountain-peak&mdash;Salève with its outlook over the snowy splendour of
Mont Blanc&mdash;instils itself here into the mourner's mood, as, long
before, a like scene had animated the young disciples of the
Grammarian; while the "cold music" of Galuppi's Toccata seems to be
echoed inauspiciously in these lingering trochaics. Something of both
moods survives, but the dominant tone is a somewhat grey and tempered
hope, remote indeed from the oppressive sense of evanescence, the
crumbling mortality, of the second poem, remote no less from the hushed
exaltation, the subdued but rapturous confidence of the first.</p>

<p>The poet is growing old; the unity of poetic vision is breaking up
into conflicting aspects only to be adjusted in the give and take of
debate; he puts off his singing robes to preside as moderator, while
Fancy and Reason exchange thrust and parry on the problem of
immortality; delivering at last, as the "sad <a name="page218"
id="page218">summing</a> up of all," a balanced and
tentative affirmation. And he delivers the decision with an oppressive
sense that it is but his own. He is "Athanasius contra mundum"; and he
dwells, with a "pallid smile" which Athanasius did not inspire, upon the
marvellous power of fame. Nay, Athanasius himself has his doubts. Even
his sober hope is not a secure possession; but in the gloom of London's
November he remembers that he had hoped in the sunset glory of Salève,
and "saves up" the memory of that pregnant hour for succour in less
prosperous times.</p>

<p>The <i>Two Poets of Croisic</i>, published with <i>La Saisiaz</i>,
cannot be detached from it. The opening words take up the theme of
"Fame," there half mockingly played with, and the whole poem is a
sarcastic criticism of the worship of Fame. The stories of René
Gentilhomme and Paul Desfarges Maillard are told with an immense burly
vivacity, in the stanza, and a Browningesque version of the manner, of
<i>Beppo</i>. Both stories turned upon those decisive moments which
habitually caught Browning's eye. Only, in their case, the decisive
moment was not one of the revealing crises which laid bare their utmost
depths, but a crisis which temporarily invested them with a capricious
effulgence. Yet these instantaneous transformations have a peculiar
charm for Browning; they touch and fall in with his fundamental ideas
of life; and the delicious prologue and epilogue hint these graver
analogies in a dainty music which pleasantly relieves the riotous
uncouthness of the tale <a name="page219" id="page219">itself</a>.
If René's life is suddenly lighted up, so is the moss bank with the
"blue flash" of violets in spring; and the diplomatic sister through
whose service Paul wins his laurels has a more spiritual comrade in the
cicada, who, with her little heart on fire, sang forth the note of the
broken string and won her singer his prize. Browning's pedestrian verse
passes into poetry as he disengages from the transient illusions, the
flickerings and bickerings, of Fame, the eternal truth of Love. But it
is only in the closing stanzas of the main poem that his thought clearly
emerges; when, having exposed the vanity of fame as a test of poetic
merit, he asks how, then, poets shall be tried; and lays down the
characteristic criterion, a happy life. But it is the happiness of Rabbi
ben Ezra, a joy three parts pain, the happiness won not by ignoring evil
but by mastering it!&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE LAST DECADE.</h4>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in4">Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiled.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Since the catastrophe of 1861 Browning had not
entered Italy. In the autumn of 1878 he once more bent his steps
thither. Florence, indeed, he refused to revisit; it was burnt in upon
his brain by memories intolerably dear. But in Venice the charm of
Italy reasserted itself, and he returned during his remaining autumns
with increasing frequency to the old-fashioned hostelry, Dell'
Universo, on the Grand Canal, or latterly, to the second home provided
by the hospitality of his gifted and congenial American friend, Mrs
Arthur Bronson. Asolo, too, the town of Pippa, he saw again, after
forty years' absence, with poignant feelings,&mdash;"such things have
begun and ended with me in the interval!" But the poignancy of memory
did not restore the magic of perception which had once been his. The
mood described ten years later in the Prologue to <i>Asolando</i> was
already dominant: <a name="page221" id="page221">the</a> iris glow of
youth no longer glorified every common object of the natural world, but
"a flower was just a flower." The glory still came by moments; some of
his most thrilling outbursts of song belong to this time. But he built
up no more great poems. He was approaching seventy, and it might well
seem that if so prolific a versifier was not likely to become silent
his poetry was rapidly resolving itself into wastes of theological
argument, of grotesque posturing, or intellectualised anecdotage. The
<i>Dramatic Idyls</i> of 1879 and 1880 showed that these more serious
forebodings were at least premature. There was little enough in them,
no doubt, of the qualities traditionally connected with "idyll."
Browning habitually wore his rue with a difference, and used familiar
terms in senses of his own. There is nothing here of "enchanted
reverie" or leisurely pastoralism. Browning's "idyls" are studies in
life's moments of stress and strain, not in its secluded pleasances and
verdurous wooded ways. It is for the most part some new variation of
his familiar theme&mdash;the soul taken in the grip of a tragic crisis,
and displaying its unsuspected deeps and voids. Not all are of this
kind, however; and while his keenness for intense and abnormal effects
is as pronounced as ever, he seeks them in an even more varied field.
Italy, the main haunt of his song, yields&mdash;it can hardly be said
to have inspired&mdash;one only of the <i>Idyls</i>&mdash;<i>Pietro of
Abano</i>. Old memories of Russia are furbished up in <i>Iván
Ivánovitch</i>, odd gatherings <a name="page222" id="page222">from</a>
the byways of England and America in <i>Ned Bratts, Halbert and Hob,
Martin Relph</i>; and he takes from Virgil's hesitating lips the hint
of a joyous pagan adventure of the gods, and tells it with his own
brilliant plenitude and volubility. The mythic treatment of
nature had never appealed much to Browning, even as a gay decorative
device; he was presently to signalise his rejection of it in <i>Gerard
de Lairesse</i>, a superb example of what he rejected. In all mythology
there was something foreign to the tenacious humanity of his intellect;
he was most open to its appeal where it presented divinity stretching
forth a helping hand to man. The noble "idyl" of <i>Echetlos</i> is
thus a counterpart, in its brief way, to the great tragic tale of
Herakles and Alkestis. Echetlos, the mysterious ploughman who shone
amid the ranks at Marathon,</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in9">"clearing Greek earth of weed</span><br />
      As he routed through the Sabian and rooted up the Mede,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is one of the many figures which thrill us with
Browning's passion for Greece, and he is touched with a kind of magic
which it did not lie in his nature often to communicate. But the great
successes of the <i>Dramatic Idyls</i> are to be found mainly among the
tales of the purely human kind that Browning had been used to tell.
<i>Pheidippides</i> belongs to the heroic line of <i>How they brought
the Good News</i> and <i>Hervé Riel</i>. The poetry of crisis, of the
sudden, unforeseen, and irremediable critical moment, upon which so
much of Browning's <a name="page223" id="page223">psychology</a>
converges, is carried to an unparalleled point of intensity in
<i>Clive</i> and <i>Martin Relph</i>. And in most of these "idyls"
there emerges a trait always implicit in Browning but only distinctly
apparent in this last decade&mdash;the ironical contrasts between the
hidden deeps of a man's soul and the assumptions or speculations of his
neighbours about it. The two worlds&mdash;inner and outer&mdash;fall
more sharply apart; stranger abysses of self-consciousness appear on
the one side, more shallow and complacent illusions on the other.
Relph's horror of remorse&mdash;painted with a few strokes of
incomparable intensity, like his 'Get you behind the man I am now, you
man that I used to be!'&mdash;is beyond the comprehension of the
friendly peasants; Clive's "fear" is as much misunderstood by his
auditor as his courage by the soldiers; the "foolishness" of Muleykeh
equally illudes his Arab comrades; the Russian villagers, the Pope, and
the lord have to fumble through a long process of argument to the
conclusion which for Iván had been the merest matter of fact from the
first. Admirable in its quiet irony is the contrast between the stormy
debate over his guilt or innocence and his serene security of mind as he
sits cutting out a toy for his children:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in8">"They told him he was free</span><br />
      As air to walk abroad; 'How otherwise?' asked he."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With the "wild men" Halbert and Hob it is the spell
of a sudden memory which makes an abrupt rift <a name="page224"
id="page224">between</a> the men they have seemed to be and
the men they prove. Browning in his earlier days had gloried in these
moments of disclosure; now they served to emphasise the normal illusion.
"Ah me!" sounds the note of the proem to the second series, scornful and
sad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in5">"Ah me!</span><br />
      So ignorant of man's whole,<br />

      <span class="in3">Man's soul!"</span></p>
</div>

<p>The volume called <i>Jocoseria</i> (1883) contains some fine things,
and abounds with Browning's invariable literary accomplishment and
metrical virtuosity, but on the whole points to the gradual
disintegration of his genius. "Wanting is&mdash;what?" is the
significant theme of the opening lyric, and most of the poetry has
something which recalls the "summer redundant" of leaf and flower not
"breathed above" by vitalising passion. Compared with the <i>Men and
Women</i> or the <i>Dramatis Personæ</i>, the <i>Jocoseria</i> as a
whole are indeed</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Framework which waits for a picture to frame, ...<br />
      Roses embowering with nought they embower."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Browning, the poet of the divining imagination, is
less apparent here than the astute ironical observer who delights in
pricking the bubbles of affectation, stripping off the masks of sham,
and exhibiting human <a name="page225" id="page225">nature</a> in
unadorned nakedness. <i>Donald</i> is an exposure, savage and
ugly, of savagery and ugliness in Sport; <i>Solomon and Balkis</i> a
reduction, dainty and gay, of these fabled paragons of wisdom to the
dimensions of ordinary vain and amorous humanity. Lilith and Eve unmask
themselves under stress of terror, as Balkis and Solomon at the
compulsion of the magic ring, and Adam urbanely replaces the mask.
Jochanan Hakka-dosh, the saintly prop of Israel, expounds from his
deathbed a gospel of struggle and endurance in which a troubled echo of
the great strain of Ben Ezra may no doubt be heard; but his career is,
as a whole, a half-sad, half-humorous commentary on the vainness of
striving to extend the iron frontiers of mortality. Lover, poet,
soldier, statist have each contributed a part of their lives to prolong
and enrich the saint's: but their fresh idealisms have withered when
grafted upon his sober and sapless brain; while his own garnered wisdom
fares no better when committed to the crude enthusiasm of his disciples.
But twice, in this volume, a richer and fuller music sounds. In the
great poem of <i>Ixion</i>, human illusions are still the preoccupying
thought; but they appear as fetters, not as specious masks, and instead
of the serio-comic exposure of humanity we see its tragic and heroic
deliverance. Ixion is Browning's Prometheus. The song that breaks from
his lips as he whirls upon the penal wheel of Zeus is a great liberating
cry of defiance to the phantom-god&mdash;man's creature and his
ape&mdash;<a name="page226" id="page226">who</a> may plunge the body in
torments but can never so baffle the soul but that</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p><span class="in2">"From the tears and sweat and blood of his torment</span><br />
      Out of the wreck he rises past Zeus to the Potency o'er him,<br />
      Pallid birth of my pain&mdash;where light, where light is, aspiring,<br />
      Thither I rise, whilst thou&mdash;Zeus take thy godship and sink."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And in <i>Never the Time and the Place</i>, the
pang of love's aching void and the rapture of reunion blend in one
strain of haunting magical beauty, the song of an old man in whom one
memory kindles eternal youth, a song in which, as in hardly another,
the wistfulness of autumn blends with the plenitude of spring.</p>

<p>Browning spent the summer months of 1883 at Gressoney St Jean, a
lonely spot high up in the Val d'Aosta, living, as usual when abroad,
on the plainest of vegetable diet. "Delightful Gressoney!" he wrote,</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Who laughest, 'Take what is, trust what may be!'"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And a mood of serene acquiescence in keeping with
the scene breathes from the poem which occupied him during this
pleasant summer. To Browning's old age, as to Goethe's, the calm wisdom
and graceful symbolism of Persia offered a peculiar attraction. In the
<i>Westöstlicher Divan</i>, seventy years earlier, Goethe, with a
subtler sympathy, laid his finger upon the common germs of Eastern and
Western thought and poetry. <a name="page227" id="page227">Browning</a>,
far less in actual touch with the Oriental mind, turned to the
East in quest of picturesque habiliments for his very definitely
European convictions&mdash;"Persian garments," which had to be
"changed" in the mind of the interpreting reader.</p>

<p>The <i>Fancies</i> have the virtues of good fables,&mdash;pithy
wisdom, ingenious moral instances, homely illustrations, easy
colloquial dialogue; and the ethical teaching has a striking
superficial likeness to the common-sense morality of prudence and
content, which fables, like proverbs, habitually expound. "Cultivate
your garden, don't trouble your head about insoluble riddles, accept
your ignorance and your limitations, assume your good to be good and
your evil to be evil, be a man and nothing more"&mdash;such is the
recurring burden of Ferishtah's counsel. But such preaching on
Browning's lips always carried with it an implicit assumption that the
preacher had himself somehow got outside the human limitations he
insisted on; that he could measure the plausibility of man's
metaphysics and theology, and distinguish between the anthropomorphism
which is to be acquiesced in because we know no better,
and that which is to be spurned because we know too much. Ferishtah's
thought is a game of hide-and-seek, and its movements have all the
dexterity of winding and subterfuge proper to success in that game.
Against the vindictive God of the creeds he trusts his human assurance
that pain is God's instrument to educate us into pity <a name="page228"
id="page228">and</a> love; but when it is asked how a just God can
single out sundry fellow-mortals</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"To undergo experience for our sake,<br />
      Just that the gift of pain, bestowed on them,<br />
      In us might temper to the due degree<br />
      Joy's else-excessive largess,"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">instead of admitting a like appeal to the same
human assurance, he falls back upon the unfathomable ways of
Omnipotence. If the rifts in the argument are in any sense supplied, it
is by the brief snatches of song which intervene between the
<i>Fancies</i>, as the cicada-note filled the pauses of the broken
string. These exquisite lyrics are much more adequate expressions of
Browning's faith than the dialogues which professedly embody it. They
transfer the discussion from the jangle of the schools and the cavils
of the market-place to the passionate persuasions of the heart and the
intimate experiences of love, in which all Browning's mysticism had its
root. Thus Ferishtah's pragmatic, almost philistine, doctrine of
"Plot-culture," by which human life is peremptorily walled in within
its narrow round of tasks, "minuteness severed from immensity," is
followed by the lyric which tells how Love transcends those limits,
making an eternity of time and a universe of solitude. Finally, the
burden of these wayward intermittent strains of love-music is caught
up, with an added intensity drawn from the poet's personal love and
sorrow, in the noble Epilogue. As he listens to the call of Love, the
world becomes an enchanted place, resounding with <a name="page229"
id="page229">the</a> triumph of good and the exultant battle-joy of
heroes. But a "chill wind" suddenly disencharms the enchantment, a
doubt that buoyant faith might be a mirage conjured up by Love
itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in6">"What if all be error,</span><br />
      If the halo irised round my head were&mdash;Love, thine arms?"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He disdains to answer; for the last words glow with
a fire which of itself dispels the chill wind. A faith founded upon
love had for Browning a surer guarantee than any founded upon reason;
it was secured by that which most nearly emancipated men from the
illusions of mortality, and enabled them to see things as they are seen
by God.</p>

<p>The <i>Parleyings with Certain People of Importance in their Day</i>
(1887) is a more laboured and, save for one or two splendid episodes, a
less remarkable achievement than <i>Ferishtah</i>. All the burly
diffuseness which had there been held in check by a quasi-oriental
ideal of lightly-knit facility and bland oracular pithiness, here has
its way without stint, and no more songs break like the rush of birds'
wings upon the dusty air of colloquy. Thrusting in between the lyrics
of <i>Ferishtah</i> and <i>Asolando</i>, these <i>Parleyings</i> recall
those other "people of importance" whose intrusive visit broke in upon
"the tenderness of Dante." Neither their importance in their own day
nor their relative obscurity, for the most part, in ours, had much to
do with Browning's choice. They do not illustrate merely his normal
interest in <a name="page230" id="page230">the</a> obscure freaks and
out-of-the-way anomalies of history. The doings of these "people" had
once been "important" to Browning himself, and the old man's memory
summoned up these forgotten old-world friends of his boyhood to be
championed or rallied by their quondam disciple. The death of the
dearest friend of his later life, J. Milsand, in 1886, probably set
these chords vibrating; the book is dedicated to his memory. Perhaps the
<i>Imaginary Conversations</i> of an older friend and master of
Browning's, one even more important in Browning's day and in ours than
in his own, and the master of his youth, once more suggested the
scheme. But these <i>Parleyings</i> are conversations only in name.
They are not even monologues of the old brilliantly dramatic kind. All
the dramatic zest of converse is gone, the personages are the merest
shadows, nothing is seen but the old poet haranguing his puppets or
putting voluble expositions of his own cherished dogmas into their
wooden lips. We have glimpses of the boy, when not yet able to compass
an octave, beating time to the simple but stirring old march of Avison
"whilom of Newcastle organist"; and before he has done, the memory
masters him, and the pedestrian blank verse breaks into a hymn "rough,
rude, robustious, homely heart athrob" to Pym the "man of men." Or he
calls up Bernard Mandeville to confute the formidable pessimism of his
old friend Carlyle&mdash;"whose groan I hear, with guffaw at the end
disposing of mock&mdash;melancholy." Gerard de Lairesse, <a
name="page231" id="page231">whose</a> rococo landscapes had
interested him as a boy, he introduces only to typify an outworn way of
art&mdash;the mythic treatment of nature; but he illustrates this
"inferior" way with a splendour of poetry that makes his ironic exposure
dangerously like an unwitting vindication. These visions of Prometheus
on the storm-swept crag, of Artemis hunting in the dawn, show that
Browning was master, if he had cared to use it, of that magnificent
symbolic speech elicited from Greek myth in the <i>Hyperion</i> or the
<i>Prometheus Unbound</i>. But it was a foreign idiom to him, and his
occasional use of it a <i>tour de force</i>.</p>

<p>Two years only now remained for Browning, and it began to be
apparent to his friends that his sturdy health was no longer secure.
His way of life underwent no change, he was as active in society as
ever, and acquaintances, old and new, still claimed his time, and added
to the burden, always cheerfully endured, of his correspondence. In
October 1887 the marriage of his son attached him by a new tie to
Italy, and the Palazzo Rezzonico on the Grand Canal, where "Pen" and
his young American wife presently settled, was to be his last, as it
was his most magnificent, abode. To Venice he turned his steps each
autumn of these last two years; lingering by the way among the
mountains or in the beautiful border region at their feet. It was thus
that, in the early autumn of 1889, he came yet once again to Asolo. His
old friend and hostess, Mrs Arthur Bronson, had discovered a pleasant,
airy abode on the old <a name="page232" id="page232">town-wall</a>,
overhanging a ravine, and Asolo, seen from this "castle
precipice-encurled," recovered all its old magic. It was here
that he put together the disconnected pieces, many written during the
last two years in London, others at Asolo itself, which were finally
published on the day of his death. The Tower of Queen Cornaro still
overlooked the little town, as it had done half a century before; and he
attached these last poems to the same tradition by giving them the
pleasant title said to have been invented by her secretary.
<i>Asolando</i>&mdash;<i>Facts and Fancies</i>, both titles contain a
hint of the ageing Browning,&mdash;the relaxed physical energy which
allows this strenuous waker to dream (<i>Reverie; Bad Dreams</i>); the
flagging poetic power, whose fitful flashes could no longer transfigure
the world for him, but only cast a fantastic flicker at moments across
its prosaic features. The opening lines sadly confess the wane of the
old vision:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"And now a flower is just a flower:<br />
     <span class="in1">Man, bird, beast are but beast, bird, man&mdash;</span><br />
      Simply themselves, uncinct by dower<br />
     <span class="in1">Of dyes which, when life's day began,</span><br />
      Round each in glory ran."</p>
</div>

<p>The famous Epilogue is the last cheer of an old warrior in whom the
stout fibre of heroism still held out when the finer nerve of vision
decayed; but <i>A Reverie</i> shows how heavy a strain it had to endure
in sustaining his faith that the world is governed by Love. Of outward
evidence for that conviction Browning saw less and <a name="page233"
id="page233">less</a>. But age had not dimmed his inner witness, and
those subtle filaments of mysterious affinity which, for Browning,
bound the love of God for man to the love of man for woman, remained
unimpaired. The old man of seventy-seven was still, in his last autumn,
singing songs redolent, not of autumn, but of the perfume and the
ecstasy of spring and youth,&mdash;love-lyrics so illusively youthful
that one, not the least competent, of his critics has refused to accept
them as work of his old age. Yet <i>Now</i> and <i>Summum Bonum</i>,
and <i>A Pearl, a Girl</i>, with all their apparent freshness and
spontaneity, are less like rapt utterances of passion than eloquent
analyses of it by one who has known it and who still vibrates with the
memory. What preoccupies and absorbs him is not the woman, but the
wonder of the transfiguration wrought for him by her word or
kiss,&mdash;the moment made eternal, the "blaze" in which he became
"lord of heaven and earth." But some of the greatest love-poetry of the
world&mdash;from Dante onwards&mdash;has reflected an intellect
similarly absorbed in articulating a marvellous experience. For the
rest, <i>Asolando</i> is a miscellany of old and new,&mdash;bright
loose drift from the chance moods of genius, or bits of anecdotic
lumber carefully recovered and refurbished, as in prescience of the
nearing end.</p>

<p>Yet no such prescience appears to have been his. His buoyant
confidence in his own vitality held its own. He was full of schemes of
work. At the end of October the idyllic days at Asolo ended, and
Browning repaired for the last time to the Palazzo <a name="page234"
id="page234">Rezzonico</a>. A month later he caught a bronchial
catarrh; failure of the heart set in, and on the evening of December 12
he peacefully died. On the last day of the year his body was laid to
rest in "Poets' Corner."</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="noindent">"I have, you are to know," Browning once wrote to
Miss Haworth, "such a love for flowers and leaves ... that I every now
and then in an impatience at being unable to possess them thoroughly,
to see them quite, satiate myself with their scent,&mdash;bite them to
bits." "All poetry," he wrote some twenty years later to Ruskin, "is
the problem of putting the infinite into the finite." Utterances like
these, not conveyed through the lips of some "dramatic" creation, but
written seriously in his own person to intimate friends, give us a <a
name="page238" id="page238">clue</a> more valuable it may be than some
other utterances which are oftener quoted and better known, to the
germinal impulses of Browning's poetic work. "Finite" and "infinite"
were words continually on his lips, and it is clear that both sides of
the antithesis represented instincts rooted in his mental nature,
drawing nourishment from distinct but equally fundamental springs of
feeling and thought. Each had its stronghold in a particular psychical
region. The province and feeding-ground of his passion for "infinity"
was that eager and restless self-consciousness which he so vividly
described in <i>Pauline</i>, seeking to "be all, have, see, know,
taste, feel all," to become all natures, like Sordello, yet
retain the law of his own being. "I pluck the rose and love it more than
tongue can speak," says the lover in <i>Two in the Campagna</i>.
Browning had his full portion of the romantic idealism which, under the
twofold stimulus of literary and political revolution, had animated the
poetry of the previous generation. But while he clearly shared the
uplifted aspiring spirit of Shelley, it assumed in him a totally
different character. Shelley abhors limits, everything grows evanescent
and ethereal before his solvent imagination, the infinity he aspires
after unveils itself at his bidding, impalpable, undefined, "intense,"
"inane." Whereas Browning's restlessly aspiring temperament worked under
the control of an eye and ear that fastened with peculiar emphasis and
eagerness upon all the limits, the dissonances, the angularities that
Shelley's harmonising fancy dissolved away. The <a name="page239"
id="page239">ultimate</a> psychological result was that the brilliant
clarity and precision of his imagined forms gathered richness and
intensity of suggestion from the vaguer impulses of temperament, and
that an association was set up between them which makes it literally
true to say that, for Browning, the "finite" is not the rival or the
antithesis, but the very language of the "infinite,"&mdash;that the
vastest and most transcendent realities have for him their <i>points
d'appui</i> in some bit of intense life, some darting bird or insect,
some glowing flower or leaf. Existence ebbs away from the large,
featureless, monotonous things, to concentrate itself in a spiked
cypress or a jagged mountain cleft. A placid soul without "incidents"
arrests him less surely than the fireflies on a mossy bank. Hence,
while "the finite" always appears, when explicitly contrasted with "the
infinite," as the inferior,&mdash;as something <i>soi-disant</i>
imperfect and incomplete,&mdash;its actual status and function in
Browning's imaginative world rather resembles that of Plato's
&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf; in relation to the
&alpha;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&omicron;&nu;,&mdash;the saving "limit"
which gives definite existence to the limitless vague.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Hence Browning, while a romantic in temper, was, in comparison with
his predecessors, a thorough realist in method. All the Romantic poets
of the previous generation had refused and decried some large portion of
reality. Wordsworth had averted his ken from half <a name="page240"
id="page240">of</a> human fate; Keats and Shelley turned from the
forlornness of human society as it was to the transfigured humanity of
myth. All three were out of sympathy with civilisation; and their
revolt went much deeper than a distaste for the types of men it bred.
They attacked a triumphant age of reason in its central fastness, the
brilliant analytic intelligence to which its triumphs were apparently
due. Keats declaimed at cold philosophy which undid the rainbow's
spells; Shelley repelled the claim of mere understanding to settle the
merits of poetry; Wordsworth, the profoundest, though by no means the
most cogent or connected, thinker of the three, denounced the "meddling
intellect" which murders to dissect, and strove to strip language
itself of every element of logic and fancy, as distortions of the
truth, only to be uttered in the barest words, which comes to the heart
that watches and receives. On all these issues Browning stands in
sharp, if not quite absolute, contrast. "Barbarian," as he has been
called, and as in a quite intelligible sense he was, he found his
poetry pre-eminently among the pursuits, the passions, the interests
and problems, of civilised men. His potent gift of imagination never
tempted him, during his creative years, to assail the sufficiency
of intellect, or to disparage the intellectual and "artificial" elements
of speech; on the contrary, he appears from the outset employing in the
service of poetry a discursive logic of unsurpassed swiftness and
dexterity, and a vast heterogeneous army of words gathered, like a
sudden levy, with <a name="page241" id="page241">a</a> sole eye to
their effective force, from every corner of civilised life, and wearing
the motley of the most prosaic occupations. It was only in the closing
years that he began to distrust the power of thought to get a grip upon
reality. His delight in poetic argument is often doubtless that of the
ironical casuist, looking on at the self-deceptions of a soul; but his
interest in ideas was a rooted passion that gave a thoroughly new, and
to many readers most unwelcome, "intellectuality" to the whole manner
as well as substance of his poetic work.</p>

<p>While Browning thus, in Nietzsche's phrase, said "Yes" to many sides
of existence which his Romantic predecessors repudiated or ignored, he
had some very definite limitations of his own. He gathered into his
verse crowded regions of experience which they neglected; but some very
glorious avenues of poetry pursued by them he refused to explore.
Himself the most ardent believer in the supernatural among all the great
poets of his time, the supernatural, as such, has hardly any explicit
place in his poetry. To the eternal beauty of myth and
folk-lore,&mdash;dream-palaces "never built at all and therefore built
for ever,"&mdash;all that province of the poetical realm which in the
memorable partition of 1797 Coleridge had taken for his own, splendidly
emulated by Shelley and by Keats, Browning the Platonist maintained on
the whole the attitude of the utilitarian man of facts. "Fairy-poetry,"
he agreed with Elizabeth Barrett in 1845-46, was "impossible <a
name="page242" id="page242">in</a> the days of steam." With a faith in
a transcendent divine world as assured as Dante's or Milton's, he did
not aspire to "pass the flaming bounds of Space or Time," or "to
possess the sun and stars." No reader of <i>Gerard de Lairesse</i> at
one end of his career, or of the vision of <i>Paracelsus</i>
at the other, or <i>Childe Roland</i> in the middle, can mistake the
capacity; but habit is more trustworthy than an occasional <i>tour de
force</i>; and Browning's imagination worked freely only when it bodied
forth a life in accord with the waking experience of his own day. "A
poet never dreams," said his philosophical Don Juan, "we prose folk
always do"; and the epigram brilliantly announced the character of
Browning's poetic world,&mdash;the world of prose illuminated through
and through in every cranny and crevice by the keenest and most
adventurous of exploring intellects.</p>

<p>In physical organisation Browning's endowment was decidedly of the
kind which prompts men to "accept the universe" with joyful alacrity.
Like his contemporary Victor Hugo, he was, after all reserves have been
made, from first to last one of the healthiest and heartiest of men. If
he lacked the burly stature and bovine appetite with which young Hugo a
little scandalised the delicate sensibilities of French Romanticism, he
certainly "came eating and drinking," and amply equipped with nerve and
muscle, activity, accomplishment, social instinct, and <i>savoir faire</i>.
The isolating loneliness of genius was checkmated by a profusion of <a
name="page243" id="page243">the</a> talents which put men <i>en
rapport</i> with their kind. The reader of his biography is apt to miss
in it the signs of that heroic or idealist detachment which he was
never weary of extolling in his verse. He is the poet <i>par
excellence</i> of the glory of failure and dissatisfaction: but
his life was, in the main, that of one who succeeded and who was
satisfied with his success. In the vast bulk of his writings we look in
vain for the "broken arc," the "half-told tale," and it is
characteristic that he never revised. Even after the great sorrow of his
life, the mood of <i>Prospice</i>, though it may have underlain all his
other moods, did not suppress or transform them; he "lived in the world
and loved earth's way," and however assured that this earth is not his
only sphere, did not wish</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in4">"the wings unfurled</span><br />
      That sleep in the worm, they say."</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever affinities Browning may have with the mystic or the
symbolist for whom the whole sense-world is but the sign of spiritual
realities, it is plain that this way of envisaging existence found
little support in the character of his senses. He had not the brooding
eye, beneath which, as it gazes, loveliness becomes far lovelier, but
an organ aggressively alert, minutely inquisitive, circumstantially
exact, which perceived the bearings of things, and explored their
intricacies, noted how the mortar was tempered in the walls and if any
struck a woman or beat a horse, but was as little prone to <a
name="page244" id="page244">transfigure</a> these or other
things with the glamour of mysterious suggestion as the eye of Peter
Bell himself. He lacked the stranger and subtler sensibilities of eye
and ear, to which Nature poetry of the nineteenth century owes so much.
His senses were efficient servants to an active brain, not magicians
flinging dazzling spells into the air before him or mysterious music
across his path. By a curious and not unimportant peculiarity he could
see a remote horizon clearly with one eye, and read the finest print in
twilight with the other; but he could not, like Wordsworth, hear the
"sound of alien melancholy" given out from the mountains before a storm.
The implicit realism of his eye and ear was fortified by acute tactual
and muscular sensibilities. He makes us vividly aware of surface and
texture, of space, solidity, shape. Matter with him is not the
translucent, tenuous, half-spiritual substance of Shelley, but
aggressively massive and opaque, tense with solidity. And he had in an
eminent degree the quick and eager apprehension of space&mdash;relations
which usually goes with these developed sensibilities of eye and muscle.
There is a hint of it in an early anecdote. "Why, sir, you are quite a
geographer!" he reported his mother to have said to him when, on his
very first walk with her, he had given her an elaborate imaginary
account of "his houses and estates."<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref62" id="fnref62" href="#fn62">[62]</a></span> But it was
only late in life that this acute plasticity and concreteness of his
sensibility found its <a name="page245" id="page245">natural</a>
outlet. When in their last winter at Rome (1860-61) he took to
clay-modelling, it was with an exultant rapture which for the time
thrust poetry into the shade. "The more tired he has been, and the more
his back ached, poor fellow," writes his wife, "the more he has exulted
and been happy&mdash;no, nothing ever made him so happy before."<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref63" id="fnref63" href="#fn63">[63]</a></span>
This was the immense joy of one who has at length found the key after
half a lifetime of trying at the lock.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>


<p>And yet realism as commonly understood is a misleading term for
Browning's art. If his keen objective senses penned his imagination,
save for a few daring escapades, within the limits of a somewhat normal
actuality, it exercised, within those limits, a superb individuality of
choice. The acute observer was doubled with a poet whose vehement and
fiery energy and intense self-consciousness influenced what he observed,
and yet far more what he imagined and what he expressed. It is possible
to distinguish four main lines along which this determining bias told.
He gloried in the strong sensory-stimulus of glowing colour, of dazzling
light; in the more complex <i>motory</i>-stimulus of intricate, abrupt,
and plastic form,&mdash;feasts for the agile eye; in all the signs of
power, exciting a kindred joy by sympathy; and in all the signs of
conscious life or "soul," <a name="page246" id="page246">exciting</a> a
joy which only reaches its height when it is enforced by those more
elemental and primitive springs of joy, when he is engaged with souls
that glow like a flower or a gem, with souls picturesquely complex and
diversified, or vehement, aspiring, heroic. In each of those four
domains, light and colour, form, power, soul, Browning had a profound,
and in the fullest sense creative, joy, which in endless varieties and
combinations dominated his imagination, controlled and pointed its
flight, and determined the contents, the manner, and the atmosphere of
his poetic work. To trace these operations in detail will be the
occupation of the five following sections.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<h4>1. JOY IN LIGHT AND COLOUR.</h4>

<p>Browning's repute as a thinker and "teacher" long overshadowed his
glory as a singer, and it still to some extent impedes the recognition
of his bold and splendid colouring. It is true that he is never a
colourist pure and simple; his joy in light and colour is never merely
epicurean. Poets so great as Keats often seem to sit as luxurious
guests at their own feasts of sense; Browning has rather the air of a
magnificent dispenser, who "provides and not partakes." His colouring
is not subtle; it recalls neither the æthereal opal of Shelley nor the
dewy flushing glow and "verdurous glooms" of Keats, nor the <a
name="page247" id="page247">choice</a> and cultured splendour of
Tennyson; it is bold, simple, and intense. He neglects the
indecisive and subdued tones; the mingled hues chiefly found in Nature,
or the tender "silvery-grey" of Andrea's placid perfection. He dazzles
us with scarlet and crimson; with rubies, and blood, and "the poppy's
red effrontery," with topaz, and amethyst, and the glory of gold, makes
the sense ache with the lustre of blue, and heightens the effect of all
by the boldest contrast. Who can doubt that he fell the more readily
upon one of his quaintest titles because of the priestly ordinance that
the "Pomegranates" were to be "of blue and of purple and of scarlet,"
and the "Bells" "of gold"? He loves the daybreak hour of the world's
awakening vitality as poets of another temper love the twilight; the
splendour of sunrise pouring into the chamber of Pippa, and steeping
Florence in that "live translucent bath of air"<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref64" id="fnref64" href="#fn64">[64]</a></span>; he loves the
blaze of the Italian mid-day&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Great noontides, thunderstorms, all glaring pomps<br />
      That triumph at the heels of June the god."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even a violet-bed he sees as a "flash" of
"blue."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref65" id="fnref65"
href="#fn65">[65]</a></span> He loves the play of light on golden hair,
and rarely imagines womanhood without it, even in the sombre South and
the dusky East; Poiphyria and Lady Carlisle, <a name="page248"
id="page248">Evelyn</a> Hope and the maid of Pornic, share the gift
with Anael the Druse, with Sordello's Palma, whose</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in9">"tresses curled</span><br />
      Into a sumptuous swell of gold, and wound<br />
      About her like a glory! even the ground<br />
      Was bright as with spilt sunbeams;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the girl in <i>Love among the Ruins</i>, and
the "dear dead women" of Venice. His love of fire and of the imagery of
flame has one of its sources in his love of light. Verona emerges from
the gloom of the past as "a darkness kindling at the core." He sees the
"pink perfection of the cyclamen," the "rose bloom o'er the summit's
front of stone." And, like most painters of the glow of light, he
throws a peculiar intensity into his glooms. When he paints a dark
night, as in <i>Pan and Luna</i>, the blackness is a solid jelly-like
thing that can be cut. And even night itself falls short of the pitchy
gloom that precedes the Eastern vision, breaking in despair "against
the soul of blackness there," as the gloom of Saul's tent discovers
within it "a something more black than the blackness," the sustaining
tent-pole, and then Saul himself "gigantic and blackest of all."</p>

<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn64" id="fn64" href="#fnref64">[64]</a></span>
"I never grow tired of sunrises," he wrote in a letter, recently

</div>

<p>But mostly the foil is a vivid, even strident, contrast. He sees the
"old June weather" blue above, and the</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in7">"great opaque</span><br />
      Blue breadth of sea without a break"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">under the walls of the seaside palazzo in Southern
Italy, "where the baked cicala dies of drouth"; and <a name="page249"
id="page249">the</a> blue lilies about the harp of golden-haired David;
and Solomon gold-robed in the blue abyss of his cedar house, "like the
centre spike of gold which burns deep in the blue-bell's womb";<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref66" id="fnref66" href="#fn66">[66]</a></span>
and the "gaze of Apollo" through the gloom of Verona woods;<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref67" id="fnref67" href="#fn67">[67]</a></span>
he sees the American pampas&mdash;"miles and miles of gold
and green," "where the sunflowers blow in a solid glow," with a
horse&mdash;"coal-black"&mdash;careering across it; and his swarthy
Ethiop uses the yellow poison-wattles of a lizard to divine with.<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref68" id="fnref68" href="#fn68">[68]</a></span>
If he imagines the "hairy-gold orbs" of the sorb-fruit, they must be
ensconced in "black glossy myrtle-berries," foils in texture as in
hue;<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref69" id="fnref69" href="#fn69">[69]</a></span>
and he neglects the mellow harmonies of autumnal decay in order to
paint the leaf which is like a splash of blood intense, abrupt, across
the flame of a golden shield.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref70"
id="fnref70" href="#fn70">[70]</a></span> He makes the most of every
hint of contrast he finds, and delights in images which accentuate the
rigour of antithesis; Cleon's mingled black and white slaves remind him
of a tesselated pavement, and Blougram's fluctuating faith and doubt of
a chess-board. And when, long after the tragic break-up of his Italian
home, he reverted in thought to Miss Blagden's Florentine garden, the
one impression that sifted itself out in his tell-tale memory was of
spots of colour and light upon dark backgrounds,&mdash;"the herbs in
red flower, and the butterflies on the top of the wall under the
olive-trees."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref71" id="fnref71"

<p>Browning's colouring is thus strikingly expressive of the build of
his mind, as sketched above. It is the colouring of a realist in so far
as it is always caught from life, and never fantastic or mythical. But
it is chosen with an instinctive and peremptory bias of eye and
imagination&mdash;the index of a mind impatient of indistinct
confusions and placid harmony, avid of intensity, decision, and
conflict.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<h4>2. JOY IN FORM.</h4>

<p>If the popular legend of Browning ignores his passion for colour, it
altogether scouts the suggestion that he had a peculiar delight in form.
By general consent he lacked the most ordinary and decent attention to
it. No doubt he is partly responsible for this impression himself. His
ideals of literary form were not altogether those commonly recognised in
literature. If we understand by form the quality of clear-cut outline
and sharply defined articulation, there is a sense in which it was one
of the most ingrained instincts of his nature, indulged at times with
even morbid excess. Alike in life and in art he hated sloth,&mdash;the
slovenliness of the "ungirt loin" and of the indecisive touch. In
conduct, this animus expressed itself in a kind of punctilious
propriety. The forms of social convention Browning observed not merely
with the scrupulous respect of the man of fashion, but with the
enthusiasm of the <a name="page251" id="page251">virtuoso</a>. Near
akin in genius to the high priests of the Romantic temple, Browning
rarely, even in the defiant heyday of adolescence, set more than a
tentative foot across the outer precincts of the Romantic Bohemia. His
"individualism" was not of the type which overflows in easy
affectations; he was too original to be eccentric, too profoundly a man
of letters to look "like a damned literary man." In his poetry this
animus took a less equivocal shape. Not a little, both of its vividness
and of its obscurity, flows from the undisciplined exuberance of his
joy in form. An acute criticism of Mrs Browning's&mdash;in some points
the very best critic he ever had&mdash;puts one aspect of this
admirably. <i>The Athenæum</i> had called him "misty." "Misty," she
retorts, "is an infamous word for your kind of obscurity. You never are
misty, not even in <i>Sordello</i>&mdash;never vague. Your graver cuts
deep sharp lines, always,&mdash;and there is an extra distinctness in
your images and thoughts, from the midst of which, crossing each other
infinitely, the general significance seems to escape."<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref72" id="fnref72" href="#fn72">[72]</a></span>
That is the overplus of form producing obscurity. But through immense
tracts of Browning the effect of the extra-distinctness of his images
and thoughts, of the deep sharp lines cut by his graver, is not thus
frustrated, but tells to the full in amazingly vivid and unforgettable
expression. Yet he is no more a realist of the ordinary type here than
in his colouring. His deep sharp lines are caught from life, but under
the <a name="page252" id="page252">control</a> of a no less definite
bias of eye and brain. Sheer nervous and muscular energy had its part
here also. As he loved the intense colours which most vigorously
stimulate the optic nerve, so he delighted in the angular, indented,
intertwining, labyrinthine varieties of line and surface which call for
the most delicate, and at the same time the most agile, adjustments of
the muscles of the eye. He caught at the edges of things&mdash;the
white line of foam against the shore, the lip of the shell, and he
could compare whiteness as no other poet ever did to "the bitten lip of
hate." He once saw with delight "a solitary bee nipping a leaf round
till it exactly fitted the front of a hole."<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref73" id="fnref73" href="#fn73">[73]</a></span> Browning's joy
in form was as little epicurean as his joy in colour; it was a banquet
of the senses in which the sense of motion and energy had the largest
part. Smooth, flowing, rounded, undulating outlines, which the eye
glides along without check, are insipid and profitless to him, and he
"welcomes the rebuff" of every jagged excrescence or ragged fray, of
every sudden and abrupt breach of continuity. His eye seizes the crisp
indentations of ferns as they "fit their teeth to the polished block"
of a grey boulder-stone;<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref74"
id="fnref74" href="#fn74">[74]</a></span> seizes
the "sharp-curled" olive-leaves as they "print the blue sky" above the
morning glories of Florence;<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref75"
id="fnref75" href="#fn75">[75]</a></span> seizes the sharp zigzag of
lightning against the Italian midnight, the fiery west through a
dungeon grating or a lurid rift in the clouds,<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref76" id="fnref76" href="#fn76">[76]</a></span>&mdash;"one
gloom, a rift <a name="page253" id="page253">of</a> fire, another
gloom,"&mdash;the brilliant line of Venice suspended "between blue and
blue." "Cup-mosses and ferns and spotty yellow leaves&mdash;all that I
love heartily," he wrote to E.B.B.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref77"
id="fnref77" href="#fn77">[77]</a></span> Roses and moss strike most
men's senses by a soft luxuriance in which all sharp articulation of
parts is merged; but what Browning seizes on in the rose is its
"labyrinthine" intricacy, while the moss becomes a little forest of
"fairy-cups and elf needles." And who else would have thought of saying
that "the fields look <i>rough</i> with hoary dew"?<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref78" id="fnref78" href="#fn78">[78]</a></span>
In the <i>Easter-Day</i> vision he sees the sky as a network of black
serrated ridges. He loves the intricate play of light and shade, and
the irregular, contorted, honeycombed surface which produces it;
craggy, scarred, indented mountains, "like an old lion's
cheek-teeth";<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref79" id="fnref79"
href="#fn79">[79]</a></span> old towns with huddled roofs and towers
picked out "black and crooked," like "fretwork," or "Turkish verse
along a scimitar"; old walls, creviced and crannied, intertwined with
creepers, and tenanted by crossing swarms of ever-busy
flies,&mdash;such things are the familiar commonplace of Browning's
sculpturesque fancy. His metrical movements are full of the same joy in
"fretwork" effects&mdash;verse-rhythm and sense-rhythm constantly
crossing where the reader expects them to coincide.<span

<p>Nor was his imaginative sculpture confined to low-relief. Every rift
in the surface catches his eye, and the deeper and more intricate the
recess, the more curiously his insinuating fancy explores it. Sordello's
palace is "a maze of corridors,"&mdash;"dusk winding stairs, dim
galleries." He probes the depths of the flower-bell; he pries after the
warmth and scent that lie within the "loaded curls" of his lady, and
irradiates the lizard, or the gnome,<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref81" id="fnref81" href="#fn81">[81]</a></span> in its
rock-chamber, the bee in its amber drop,<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref82" id="fnref82" href="#fn82">[82]</a></span> or in its
bud,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref83" id="fnref83" href="#fn83">[83]</a></span>
the worm in its clod. When Keats describes the closed eyes of the
sleeping Madeline he is content with the loveliness he sees:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"And still she slept an <i>azure-lidded</i> sleep."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Browning's mining fancy insists on showing us the
eye of the dead Porphyria "ensconced" within its eyelid, "like a bee in
a bud." A cleft is as seductive to his imagination as a cave to
Shelley's. In a cleft of the wind gashed Apennines he imagines the home
he would best love in all the world;<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref84" id="fnref84" href="#fn84">[84]</a></span> in a cleft the
pine-tree, symbol of hardy song,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref85"
id="fnref85" href="#fn85">[85]</a></span> strikes precarious root, the
ruined eagle finds refuge,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref86"
id="fnref86" href="#fn86">[86]</a></span> and Sibrandus
Schaffnaburgensis a watery Inferno. A like instinct allures him to
other images of deep hollow things the recesses of which <a
name="page255" id="page255">something</a> else explores and
occupies,&mdash;the image of the sheath; the image of the cup. But he
is equally allured by the opposite, or salient, kind of angularity.
Beside the Calabrian seaside house stands a "sharp tree&mdash;a
cypress&mdash;rough iron-spiked, ripe fruit o'er-crusted,"&mdash;in all
points a thoroughly Browningesque tree.</p>

<p>And so, corresponding to the cleft-like array of sheaths and cups, a
not less prolific family of <i>spikes</i> and <i>wedges</i> and
<i>swords</i> runs riot in Browning's work. The rushing of a fresh
river-stream into the warm ocean tides crystallises into the "crystal

<p>Browning's joy in abrupt and intricate form had then a definite root
in his own nervous and muscular energy. It was no mere preference which
might be indulged or not, but an instinctive bias, which deeply affected
his way not only of imagining but of conceiving the relations of things.
In this brilliant visual speech of sharply cut <a name="page256"
id="page256">angles</a> and saliences, of rugged incrustations, and
labyrinthine multiplicity, Browning's romantic hunger for the infinite
had to find its expression; and it is clear that the bias implicit in
speech imposed itself in some points upon the matter it conveyed.
Abrupt demarcations cut off soul from body, and man from God; the
infinite habitually presented itself to him as something, not
transcending and comprehending the finite, but <i>beginning where the
finite stopped</i>,&mdash;Eternity at the end of Time. But the same
imaginative passion for form which imposed some concrete limitations
upon the Absolute deprived it also of the vagueness of abstraction.
Browning's divinity is very finite, but also amazingly real and near;
not "interfused" with the world, which is full of stubborn
distinctness, but permeating it through and through, "curled
inextricably round about" all its beauty and its power,<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref92" id="fnref92" href="#fn92">[92]</a></span>
"intertwined" with earth's lowliest existence, and thrilling with
answering rapture to every throb of life. The doctrine of God's
"immanence" was almost a commonplace with Browning's generation.
Browning turned the doctrine into imaginative speech equalled in
impressiveness by that of Carlyle and by that of Emerson, but
distinguished from both by an eager articulating concrete sensibility
which lifts into touch with supreme Good all the labyrinthine
multiplicity of existence which Carlyle impatiently suppressed, while
it joyously accentuates the sharp dissonances which Emerson's ideality
ignored.</p>

<h4>3. JOY IN POWER.</h4>

<p>Browning was thus announced, we have seen, even by his splendour of
colouring and his rich and clear-cut plasticity, as something more than
a feaster upon colour and form. In his riot of the senses there was more
of the athlete than of the voluptuary. His joy was that of one to whom
nervous and muscular tension was itself a stimulating delight. In such a
temperament the feeling of energy was an elementary instinct, a
passionate obsession, which projected itself through eye and ear and
imagination into the outer world, filling it with the throbbing
pulsations or the clashing conflict of vehement powers. We know that it
was thus with Browning. "From the first Power was, I knew," he wrote in
the last autumn of his life.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref93"
id="fnref93" href="#fn93">[93]</a></span> It was a primitive instinct,
and it remained firmly rooted to the last. As Wordsworth saw Joy
everywhere, and Shelley Love, so Browning saw Power. If he later "saw
Love as plainly," it was the creative and transforming, not the
emotional, aspect of Love which caught his eye. His sense of Power
played a yet more various part in the shaping of his poetic world than
did his sense of form. But intellectual growth inevitably modified the
primitive instinct which it could not uproot; and his sense of Power
traverses the whole gamut of dynamic <a name="page258"
id="page258">tones</a>, from the lusty "barbaric" joy in the
sheer violence of ripping and clashing, to the high-wrought sensibility
which throbs in sympathy with the passionate heart-beats of the stars.</p>

<i>Asolando: Reverie.</i>
</div>

<p>No one can miss the element of savage energy in Browning. His
associates tell us of his sudden fits of indignation, "which were like
thunder-storms"; of his "brutal scorn" for effeminacy, of the "vibration

href="#fn94">[94]</a></span> The impact of hard resisting things, the
jostlings of stubborn matter bent on going its own way, attracted him
as the subtle compliances of air appealed to Shelley; and he runs riot
in the vocabulary (so abundantly developed in English) which conveys
with monosyllabic vigour to the ear these jostlings and impacts.</p>

<p class="noindent">he asks in <i>Childe Roland</i>,&mdash;altogether
an instructive example of the ways of Browning's imagination when
working, as it so rarely did, on a deliberately fantastic theme. Hear
again with what savage joy his Moon "rips the womb" of the cloud that
crosses it; Shelley's Moon, in keeping with the ways of his more
tender-hefted universe, merely <i>broke its woof</i>. So the gentle
wife of James Lee sees in a vineyard "the vines writhe in rows each
impaled on its stake."</p>

<a name="page259" id="page259"></a>
<p>His "clefts" and "wedges" owe their attraction not only to their
intricate angularity but to the violent cleavings and thrustings apart
which they result from or produce. And his clefts are as incomplete
without some wild bit of fierce or frightened life in their grip as are
Shelley's caves without some form of unearthly maidenhood in their
embrace.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref95" id="fnref95" href="#fn95">[95]</a></span>
His mountains&mdash;so rarely the benign pastoral presences of
Wordsworth&mdash;are not only craggy and rough, but invisible axes have
hewn and mutilated them,&mdash;they are fissured and cloven and

the plain and "entwine base with base to knit strength more
intensely,"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref96" id="fnref96"
href="#fn96">[96]</a></span> the image owes its grandeur to the double
suggestion of sinewy power and intertwined limbs. Still grander, but in

<p>When the hoary cripple in <i>Childe Roland</i> laughs, his
mouth-edge is "pursed and scored" with his glee; and his scorn must not
merely be uttered, but <i>written</i> with <a name="page260"

This idea is resumed yet more dramatically in the image of the palsied
oak, cleft like "a distorted mouth that splits its rim gaping at death."
Later on, thrusting his spear into the gloom, he fancies it "tangled in
a dead man's hair or beard." Similarly, Browning is habitually lured
into expressive detail by the idea of smooth surfaces frayed or
shredded,&mdash;as of flesh torn with teeth or spikes: Akiba,&mdash;</p>

<p>This savageness found vent still more freely in his rendering of
sounds. By one of those apparent paradoxes which abound in Browning,
the poet who has best interpreted the glories of music in verse, the
poet of musicians <i>par excellence</i>, is also the poet of grindings
and jostlings, of jars and clashes, of grating hinges and flapping
doors; civilisation mated with barbarism, "like Jove in a thatched
house."</p>

<p>Music appealed to him by its imaginative suggestiveness, or by its
intricate technique; as the mine from which Abt Vogler reared his
palace, the loom on which Master Hugues wove the intertwining harmonies
of his fugue. But the most dulcet harmony aroused him less surely to
vivacious expression than some "gruff hinge's invariable scold,"<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref100" id="fnref100" href="#fn100">[100]</a></span>
or the quick sharp <a name="page261" id="page261">rattle</a> of rings
down the net-poles,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref101" id="fnref101"
href="#fn101">[101]</a></span> or the hoof-beat of a galloping horse,
or the grotesque tumble of the old organist, in fancy, down the
"rotten-runged, rat-riddled stairs" of his lightless loft. There was
much in him of his own Hamelin rats' alacrity of response to sounds "as
of scraping tripe" and squeezing apples, and the rest. Milton
contrasted the harmonious swing of the gates of Paradise with the harsh
grinding of the gates of hell. Browning would have found in the latter
a satisfaction subtly allied to his zest for other forms of robust
malignity.</p>

<p>And with his joy in savage images went an even more pronounced joy in
savage words. He loved the grinding, clashing, and rending sibilants and
explosives as Tennyson the tender-hefted liquids. Both poets found their
good among Saxon monosyllables, but to Tennyson they appealed by limpid
simplicity, to Browning by gnarled and rugged force. Dante, in a famous
chapter of the <i>De Vulgari Eloquio</i><span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref102" id="fnref102" href="#fn102">[102]</a></span> laid down
a fourfold distinction among words on the analogy of the varying
texture of the hair; enjoining the poet to avoid both the extremes of
smoothness and roughness,&mdash;to prefer the "combed" and the "shaggy"
to the "tousled" and the "sleek." All four kinds had their function in
the versatile technique of Browning and Tennyson; but it is safe to say
that while Tennyson's vocabulary is focussed among the "combed" in the
direction of the "sleek," Browning's centres in the "shaggy," verging
towards <a name="page262" id="page262">the</a> "tousled."<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref103" id="fnref103" href="#fn103">[103]</a></span>
The utmost sweetness is his when he will; it is the counterpart of his
pure intensity of colouring, and of the lyric loveliness of his Pippas
and Pompilias; but</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Browning's genial violence continually produced strokes which only
needed a little access of oddity or extravagance to become grotesque. He
probably inherited a bias in this direction; we know that his father
delighted in drawing grotesque heads, and even "declared that he could
not draw a pretty face."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref104"
id="fnref104" href="#fn104">[104]</a></span> But his grotesqueness is
never the mere comic oddness which sometimes assumes the name. It is a
kind of monstrosity produced not by whimsical mutilations, but by a
riot of exuberant power. And he has also a grave and tragic use of the
grotesque, in which he stands alone. He is, in fact, by far the greatest
English master of grotesque. <i>Childe Roland</i>, where the natural
bent of his invention has full fling, abounds with grotesque traits
which, instead of disturbing the <a name="page263"
id="page263">romantic</a> atmosphere, infuse into it an element of
strange, weird, and uncanny mirth, more unearthly than any
solemnity; the day shooting its grim red leer across the plain, the old
worn-out horse with its red, gaunt, and colloped neck a-strain; or, in
<i>Paracelsus</i>, the "Cyclops-like" volcanoes "staring together with
their eyes on flame," in whose "uncouth pride" God tastes a pleasure.
Shelley had recoiled from the horrible idea of a host of these One-eyed
monsters;<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref105" id="fnref105"
href="#fn105">[105]</a></span> Browning deliberately invokes it. But he
can use grotesque effects to heighten tragedy as well as romance. One
source of the peculiar poignancy of the <i>Heretic's Tragedy</i> is the
eerie blend in it of mocking familiarity and horror.</p>

<p>Yet it was not always in this brutal and violent guise that Browning
imagined power. He was "ever a fighter," and had a sense as keen as
Byron's, and far more joyous, for storm and turbulence; but he had also,
as Byron had not, the finer sense which feels the universe tense with
implicit energies, and the profoundest silences of Nature oppressive
with the burden of life straining to the birth. The stars in <i>Saul</i>
"beat with emotion" and "shot out in fire the strong pain of pent
knowledge," and a "gathered intensity" is "brought to the grey of the
hills"; upon the lovers of <i>In a Balcony</i> evening comes "intense
<a name="page264" id="page264">with</a> yon first trembling star."
Wordsworth's "quiet" is lonely, pensive, and serene; his stars are not
beating with emotion, but "listening quietly." Browning's is hectic,
bodeful, high-strung. The vast featureless Campagna is instinct with
"passion," and its "peace with joy."<span class="fnref"><a

<p>Half the romantic spell of <i>Childe Roland</i> lies in the wonderful
suggestion of impending catastrophe. The gloom is alive with mysterious
and impalpable menace; the encompassing presences which everything
suggests and nothing betrays, grow more and more oppressively real,
until the decisive moment when Roland's blast suddenly lets them loose.</p>

<p>For the power that Browning rejoiced to imagine was pre-eminently
sudden; an unforeseen cataclysm, abruptly changing the conditions it
found, and sharply marking off the future from the past. The same bias
of imagination which crowded his inner vision of space with abrupt
angular forms tended to resolve the slow, continuous, organic energies
of the world before his inner vision into explosion and catastrophe. His
geology neglects the æons of gradual stratification; it is not the slow
stupendous upheaval of continents, but the volcanic uprush of the molten
ore among the rocks, which renew the ancient rapture of the <a
name="page265" id="page265">Paracelsian</a> God. He is the poet of the
sudden surprises of plant-life: the bud "bursting unaware" into flower,
the brushwood about the elm-tree breaking, some April morning, into
tiny leaf, the rose-flesh mushroom born in a night. The "metamorphoses
of plants,"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref108" id="fnref108"
href="#fn108">[108]</a></span> which fascinated Goethe by their inner
continuity, arrest Browning by their outward abruptness: that the
flower is implicit in the leaf was a fact of much less worth for him
than that the bud suddenly passes into something so unlike it as the
flower. The gradual coming on of spring among the mountains
concentrates itself for him in one instant of epic
sublimity,&mdash;that in which the mountain unlooses its year's load of
sound, and</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Fold on fold all at once it crowds thunderously down to<br />
     <span class="in2">his feet."</span><span class="fnref"><a name="fnref109" id="fnref109" href="#fn109">[109]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Hence his love of images which convey these sudden
transformations,&mdash;the worm, putting forth in autumn its "two
wondrous winglets,"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref110" id="fnref110"
href="#fn110">[110]</a></span> the "transcendental platan," breaking
into foliage and flower at the summit of its smooth tall bole; the
splendour of flame leaping from the dull fuel of gums and straw. In
such images <a name="page266" id="page266">we</a> see how the simple
joy in abrupt changes of sensation which belonged to his riotous energy
of nerve lent support to his peremptory way of imagining all change and
especially all vital and significant becoming. For Browning's trenchant
imagination things were not gradually evolved; a sudden touch loosed the
springs of latent power, or an overmastering energy from without rushed
in like a flood. With all his connoisseur's delight in technique,
language and sound were only spells which unlocked a power beyond their
capacity to express. Music was the "burst of pillared cloud by day and
pillared fire by night," starting up miraculously from the barren
wilderness of mechanical expedients,<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref111" id="fnref111" href="#fn111">[111]</a></span> and poetry
"the sudden rose"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref112" id="fnref112"
href="#fn112">[112]</a></span> "breaking in" at the bidding of a "brace

marvellous of human powers we may gather from the famous lines of

<h3>VII.</h3>

<h4>4. JOY IN SOUL.</h4>

<p>No saying of Browning's is more familiar than that in which he
declared "incidents in the development of <a name="page267"
id="page267">souls</a>"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref113"
id="fnref113" href="#fn113">[113]</a></span> to be to him the supreme
interest of poetry. The preceding sections of this chapter have
sufficiently shown how far this formula was from exhausting the vital
springs of Browning's work. "Little else" might be "worth study"; but a
great many other things had captured those rich sensibilities, without
which the "student's analytic zeal" might have devoured the poet. On the
other hand, his supreme interest in "incidents in the development of
souls" was something very different from the democratic enthusiasm for
humanity, or the Wordsworthian joy in the "common tears and mirth" of
"every village." The quiet routine existence of uneventful lives hardly
touched him more than the placid quiescence of animal and vegetable
existence; the commonplace of humanity excited in him no mystic rapture;
the human "primrose by the river's brim," merely as one among a throng,
was for him pretty much what it was to Peter Bell. There was no doubt a
strain of pantheistic thought in Browning which logically involved a
treatment of the commonplace as profoundly reverent as Wordsworth's own.
But his passionate faith in the divine love pervading the universe did
not prevent his turning away resolutely from regions of humanity, as of
nature, for which his poetic alchemy provided no solvent. His poetic
throne was not built on "humble truth"; and he, as little as his own
Sordello, deserved the eulogy of the plausible Naddo upon his verses as
based "on man's broad nature," and having a "staple <a name="page268"
id="page268">of</a> common-sense."<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref114" id="fnref114" href="#fn114">[114]</a></span>
The homely toiler as such, all members of homely undistinguished classes
and conditions of men, presented, <i>as</i> embodiments of those classes
and conditions, no coign of vantage to his art. In this point,
human-hearted and democratic as he was, he fell short not only of the
supreme portrayers of the eternal commonplaces of peasant
life,&mdash;of a Burns, a Wordsworth, a Millet, a Barnes,&mdash;but
even of the fastidious author of <i>The Northern Farmer</i>. Once, in a
moment of exaltation, at Venice, Browning had seen Humanity in the
guise of a poor soiled and faded bit of Venetian girlhood, and
symbolically taken her as the future mistress of his art. The programme
thus laid down was not, like Wordsworth's similarly announced resolve
to sing of "sorrow barricadoed evermore within the walls of cities,"
simply unfulfilled; but it was far from disclosing the real fountain of
his inspiration.</p>

</div>

<p>And as Browning deals little with the commonplace in human nature,
so he passes by with slight concern the natural relationships into
which men are born, as compared with those which they enter by passion
or choice. The bond of kinship, the love between parents and children,
brothers and sisters, so prolific of poetry elsewhere, is singularly
rare and unimportant in Browning, to whom every other variety of the
love between men and women was a kindling theme. The names of husband,
of wife, of lover, vibrate for him with a poetry more thrilling than
any that those <a name="page269" id="page269">names</a> excite
elsewhere in the poetry of his generation; but the mystic glory which
in Blake and Wordsworth and Coleridge gathered about unconscious
childhood is all but fled. Children&mdash;real children, naïve and
inarticulate, like little Fortù&mdash;rarely appear in his verse, and
those that do appear seem to have been first gently disengaged, like
Pippa, David, Theocrite, from all the clinging filaments of Home. In its
child pathos <i>The Pied Piper</i>&mdash;addressed to a
child&mdash;stands all but alone among his works. His choicest and
loveliest figures are lonely and unattached. Pippa, David, Pompilia,
Bordello, Paracelsus, Balaustion, Mildred, Caponsacchi, have no ties of
home and blood, or only such as work malignly upon their fate. Mildred
has no mother, and she falls; Sordello moves like a Shelleyan shadow
about his father's house; Balaustion breaks away from the ties of
kindred to become a spiritual daughter of Athens; Paracelsus goes
forth, glorious in the possession of "the secret of the world," which
is his alone; Caponsacchi, himself sisterless and motherless, releases
Pompilia from the doom inflicted on her by her parents' calculating
greed; the song of Pippa releases Luigi from the nobler but yet hurtful
bondage of his mother's love.</p>

<p>More considerable, but yet relatively slight, is the part played in
Browning's poetry by those larger and more complex communities, like the
City or the State, whose bond of membership, though less involuntary
than that of family, is still for the most part the expression of
<a name="page270" id="page270">material</a> necessity or interest, not
of spiritual discernment, passion, or choice. Patriotism, in this
sense, is touched with interest but hardly with conviction, or with
striking power, by Browning. Casa Guidi windows betrayed too much. Two
great communities alone moved his imagination profoundly; just those
two, namely, in which the bond of common political membership was most
nearly merged in the bond of a common spiritual ideal. And Browning
puts the loftiest passion for Athens in the mouth of an alien, and the
loftiest Hebraism in the mouth of a Jew of the dispersion. Responsive
to the personal cry of the solitary hero, Browning rarely caught or
cared to reproduce the vaguer multitudinous murmur of the great mass.
In his defining, isolating imagination the voice of the solitary soul
rings out with thrilling clearness, but the "still sad music of
humanity" escapes. The inchoate and the obsolescent, the indistinctness
of immaturity, the incipient disintegration of decay, the deepening
shadow of oblivion, the half-instinctive and organic bond of custom,
whatever stirs the blood but excites only blurred images in the brain,
and steals into character without passing through the gates of passion
or of thought, finds imperfect or capricious reflection in his verse.</p>

<p>Browning's interest in "soul" was not, then, a diffused enjoyment of
human nature as such. But, on the other hand, human nature stood for too
much with him, his sense of what all personality at the lowest implies
was too keen, to allow him to relish, or <a name="page271"
id="page271">make</a> much use of, those unpsychological amalgams of
humanity and thought,&mdash;the personified abstractions. Whether in
the base form branded by Wordsworth, or in the lofty and noble form of
Keats's "Autumn" and Shelley's "West Wind," this powerful instrument of
poetic expression was touched only in fugitive and casual strokes to
music by Browning's hand. Personality, to interest him, had to possess
a possible status in the world of experience. It had to be of the
earth, and like its inhabitants. The stamp of fashioning intelligence,
or even of blind myth-making instinct, alienates and warns him off. He
climbs to no Olympus or Valhalla, he wanders through no Empyrean. His
rare divinities tread the visible and solid ground. His Artemis
"prologizes" to, his Herakles plays a part in, a human drama;
and both are as frankly human themselves as the gods of Homer. Shelley
and Keats had rekindled about the faded forms of the Greek gods the
elemental Nature-worship from which they had started; Apollo, Hyperion,
are again glorious symbols of the "all-seeing" and all-vitalising Sun.
Browning, far from seeking to recover their primitive value, treats
their legends, with the easy rationalism of Euripides or Ferishtah, as a
mine of ethical and psychological illustration. He can play charmingly,
in later years, with the myth of Pan and Luna, of Arion and the
dolphin,<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref115" id="fnref115"
href="#fn115">[115]</a></span> or of Apollo and the Fates, but idyl
gets the better of nature feeling; "maid-moon" Luna is far more maid <a
name="page272" id="page272">than</a> moon. The spirit of autumn does
not focus itself for him, as for Keats, in some symbolic shape,
slumbering among the harvest swathes or at watch over the fragrant
cider-press; it breaks up into the vivid concrete traits of <i>The
Englishman in Italy</i>. The spirit of humanity is not shadowed forth

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>What, then, in the vast multifarious field of soul-life were the
points of special attraction for Browning? To put it in a word, the same
fundamental instincts of the senses and the imagination which we have
watched shaping the visible world of his poetry, equally determined the
complexion of its persons. The joy in pure and intense colour, in
abruptness of line and intricacy of structure, in energetic movement and
sudden disclosure and transformation,&mdash;all these characteristics
have their analogies in Browning's feeling for the complexion,
morphology, and dynamics of what he calls the soul. Just as this lover
of crowded labyrinthine forms surprises us at first by his masses of
pure and simple colour, untroubled by blur or modulation, so in the long
procession of Browning's men of the world, adepts in the tangled lore of
experience, there mingle from time to time figures radiant with a pure,
intense, immaculate spiritual light,&mdash;Pippa, Pompilia, the David
of the earlier <i>Saul</i>. Something of the strange charm of <a
name="page273" id="page273">these</a> naïvely beautiful beings springs
from their isolation. That detachment from the bonds of home and
kindred which was noticed above in its negative aspect, appears now as
a source of positive expressiveness. They start into unexplained
existence like the sudden beauty of flames from straw.
Browning is no poet of the home, but he is peculiarly the poet of a kind
of spirituality which subsists independently of earthly ties without
disdaining them, lonely but unconscious of loneliness. Pippa would
hardly be so recognisably steeped as she is in the very atmosphere of
Browning's mind, but for this loneliness of hers,&mdash;the loneliness
neither of the exile nor of the anchorite, but native, spontaneous, and
serene. Wordsworth sometimes recalls it, but he is apt to invest his
lonely beings with a mystic glamour which detaches them from humanity as
well as from their fellow-men. The little "H.C., six years old," is "a
dewdrop which the morn brings forth," that</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in1">"at the touch of wrong, without a strife,</span><br />
      Slips in a moment out of life."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Pippa, with all her ideality and her upward gaze,
has her roots in earth; she is not the dewdrop but the flower.</p>

<p>But loneliness belongs in a less degree to almost all characters
which seriously engaged Browning's imagination. His own intense
isolating self-consciousness infused itself into them. Each is a little
island kingdom, judged and justified by its own laws, and not entirely
intelligible <a name="page274" id="page274">to</a> the foreigner. Hence
his persistent use of the dramatic monologue. Every man had his point
of view, and his right to state his case. "Where you speak straight
out," Browning wrote in effect, as we saw, in one of his earliest
letters to his future wife, "I break the white light in the seven
colours of men and women"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref116"
id="fnref116" href="#fn116">[116]</a></span>; and each colour
had its special truth and worth. His study of character is notoriously
occupied with failures of transit between mind and mind. His lovers miss
the clue; if they find it, as in <i>By the Fireside</i>, the collapse
of the barrier walls is told with triumph, and the spell of the forests
invoked to explain it.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn116" id="fn116" href="#fnref116">[116]</a></span>
<i>R.B. to E.B.B.</i>, i. 6.
</div>

<p>And within the viewless intrenchments thus drawn about character
Browning's imagination was prone to reproduce the abrupt and intricate
play of line and surface which fascinated his outward eye. "The
care-bit, erased, broken-up beauties ever took my taste," says, in
<i>Sordello</i>, the creator of the pure flame-like soul-beauty of
Pompilia and Pippa; very much as the crumbling and blistering of the
frescoed walls are no less needful to the charm he feels in his
Southern villa than the "blue breadth of sea without break" expanding
before it. The abruptness, the sharp transitions, the startling and
picturesque contrasts which mark so much of the talk of his persons,
reflect not merely his agility of mind but his æsthetic relish for the
Gothic richness and fretted intricacy that result. The bishop <a
name="page275" id="page275">of</a> St Praxed's monologue, for instance,
is a sort of live mosaic,&mdash;anxious entreaty to his sons, diapered
with gloating triumph over old Gandulph. The larger tracts of soul-life
are apt in his hands to break up into shifting phases, or to nodulate
into sudden crises; here a Blougram, with his "chess-board" of faith
diversified by doubt, there a Paracelsus, advancing by complex
alternations of "aspiring" and "attainment." Everywhere in Browning the
slow continuities of existence are obscured by vivid moments,&mdash;the
counterpart of his bursts of sunlight through rifts and chinks. A
moment of speech with Shelley stands out, a brilliant handbreadth of
time between the blank before and after; a moment of miserable failure
blots out the whole after-life of Martin Relph; a moment of heroism
stamps once for all the quality of Clive; the whole complex story of
Pompilia focuses in the "splendid minute and no more" in which she is
"saved"; the lover's whole life is summed up in "some moment's product"
when "the soul declares itself,"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref117"
id="fnref117" href="#fn117">[117]</a></span> or utters
the upgarnered poetry of its passion; or else, conversely, he looks back
on a moment equally indelible, when the single chance of love was
missed. "It once might have been, once only," is the refrain of the
lover's regret in Browning, as "once and only once and for one only" is
the keynote of his triumph. In the contours of event and circumstance,
as in those of material objects, <a name="page276" id="page276">he</a>
loves jagged angularity, not harmonious curve. "Our interest's in the
dangerous edge of things,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"The honest thief, the tender murderer,<br />
      The superstitious atheist;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where an alien strain violently crosses the natural
course of kind; and these are only extreme examples of the abnormal
nature which always allured and detained Browning's imagination, though
it was not always the source of its highest achievement. Ivánovitch,
executing justice under the forms of murder, Caponsacchi, executing
mercy under the forms of an elopement, the savagery of Halbert and Hob
unnerved by an abrupt reminiscence,&mdash;it is in these suggestive and
pregnant situations, at the meeting-points of apparently irreconcilable
classes and kinds, that Browning habitually found or placed those of
his characters who represent any class or kind at all.</p>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn117" id="fn117" href="#fnref117">[117]</a></span>
<i>By the Fireside</i>.
</div>

<p>The exploring, in-and-out scrutinising instincts of Browning's
imagination equally left their vivid impress upon his treatment of
character. If the sharp nodosities of character caught his eye, its
mysterious recesses and labyrinthine alleys allured his curiosity; this
lover of "clefts," this pryer among tangled locks and into the depths of
flower-bells, peered into all the nooks and chambers of the soul with
inexhaustible enterprise. It is hard to deny that even <i>The Ring and
the Book</i> itself suffers something from the unflagging zest with
which the poet pursues all the windings of popular <a name="page277"
id="page277">speculation</a>, all the fretwork of Angelo de
Hyacinthis's forensic and domestic futilities. The poem is a great
poetic Mansion, with many chambers, and he will lead us sooner or later
to its inner shrine; but on the way there are "closets to search and
alcoves to importune,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in3">"The day wears,</span><br />
      <span class="in3">And door succeeds door,</span><br />
      <span class="in4">We try the fresh fortune,</span><br />
      Range the wide house from the wing to the centre."</p>
</div>

<p>For the most part, after the not wholly successful experiment of
direct analysis in <i>Sordello</i>, he chose to make his men and women
the instruments of their own illumination; and this was a second source
of his delight in the dramatic monologue. He approached all problematic
character with a bias towards disbelieving appearances, which was fed,
if not generated, by that restlessly exploring instinct of an
imagination that spontaneously resolved surface and solidity into
integument and core. Not that Browning always displays the core; on the
contrary, after elaborately removing an imposing mask from what appears
to be a face, he will hint that the unmasked face is itself a mask. "For
Blougram, he believed, say, half he spoke." Browning is less concerned
to "save" the subjects of his so-called "Special Pleadings" than to
imagine them divested of the gross disguises of public rumour about
them; not naked as God made them, but clothed in the easy undress of
their own subtly plausible illusions about <a name="page278"
id="page278">themselves</a>. But the optimist in him is always alert,
infusing into the zest of exploration a cheery faith that behind the
last investiture lurks always some soul of goodness, and welcoming with
a sudden lift of verse the escape of some diviner gleam through the
rifts, such as Blougram's&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Just when we're safest comes a sunset touch."</p>
</div>

<p>Yet it is hardly a paradox to say that his faith throve upon the
obstacles it overcame. He imagined yet more vividly than he saw, and the
stone wall which forbade vision but whetted imagination, acquired an
ideal merit in his eyes because it was not an open door. In later life
he came with growing persistence to regard the phenomenal world as a
barrier of illusion between man and truth. But instead of chilling his
faith, the obstacle only generated that poet's philosophy of the "value
of a lie" which perturbs the less experienced reader of <i>Fifine</i>.
"Truth" was "forced to manifest itself through falsehood," won thence by
the excepted eye, at the rare season, for the happy moment, till
"through the shows of sense, which ever proving false still promise to
be true," the soul of man worked its way to its final union with the
soul of God.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref118" id="fnref118"

<i>Fifine at the fair</i>, cxxiv.
</div>

<hr />

<p>And here at length if not before we have a clear glimpse of the
athlete who lurks behind the explorer. Browning's joy in imagining
impediment and illusion <a name="page279" id="page279">was</a> only
another aspect of his joy in the spiritual energy which answers to the
spur of difficulty and "works" through the shows of sense; and this
other joy found expression in a poetry of soul yet more deeply tinged
with the native hue of his mind. "From the first, Power was, I knew;"
and souls were the very central haunt and focus of its play. Not that
strong natures, as such, have much part in Browning's poetic-world; the
strength that allured his imagination was not the strength that is
rooted in nerve or brain, slowly enlarging with the build of the
organism, but the strength that has suddenly to be begotten
or infused, that leaps by the magic of spiritual influence from heart to
heart. If Browning multiplies and deepens the demarcations among
material things, he gives his souls a rare faculty of transcending them.
Bright spiritual beings like Pippa shed their souls innocently and
unwittingly about like a spilth of "X-rays," and the irradiation
penetrates instantly the dense opposing integuments of passion,
cupidity, and worldliness. At all times in his life these accesses of
spiritual power occupied his imagination. Cristina's momentary glance
and the Lady of Tripoli's dreamed-of face lift their devotees to
completeness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"She has lost me, I have gained her,<br />
      Her soul's mine, and now grown perfect<br />
      I shall pass my life's remainder."</p>
</div>

<p>Forty years later, Browning told with far greater realistic power
and a grim humour suited to the theme, <a name="page280"
id="page280">the</a> "transmutation" of Ned Bratts. Karshish has his
sudden revealing flash as he ponders the letter of Abib:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"The very God! Think, Abib, dost thou think,&mdash;<br />
      So the All-great were the All-loving too"&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the boy David his prophetic vision. A yet more
splendid vision breaks from the seemingly ruined brain of the dying
Paracelsus, and he has a gentler comrade in the dying courtier, who
starts up from his darkened chamber crying that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in4">"Spite of thick air and closed doors</span><br />
      God told him it was June,&mdash;when harebells grow,<br />
      And all that kings could ever give or take<br />
      Would not be precious as those blooms to me."</p>
</div>

<p>But it is not only in these magical transitions and transformations
that Browning's joy in soul was decisively coloured by his joy in
power. A whole class of his characters&mdash;the most familiarly
"Browningesque" division of them all&mdash;was shaped under the sway of
this master-passion; the noble army of "strivers" who succeed and of
"strivers" who fail, baffled artists and rejected lovers who mount to
higher things on stepping-stones of their frustrated selves, like the
heroes of <i>Old Painters in Florence</i>, and <i>The Last Ride
Together,</i> and <i>The Lost Mistress</i>; and on the other hand, the
artists and lovers who fail for want of this saving energy, like the
Duke and Lady of the <i>Statue and the Bust</i>, like Andrea del Sarto
and the Unknown Painter. But his <a name="page281" id="page281">very</a>
preoccupation with Art and with Love itself sprang mainly from his
peculiar joy in the ardent putting-forth of soul. No kind of vivid
consciousness was indifferent to him, but the luxurious receptivity of
the spectator or of a passively beloved mistress touched him little,
compared with the faintest pulsation of the artist's "love of loving,
rage of knowing, feeling, seeing the absolute truth of things," of the
lover's passion for union with another soul. When he describes effects
of music or painting, he passes instinctively over to the standpoint of
the composer or the performer; shows us Hugues and Andrea themselves at
the organ, or the easel; and instead of feeling the world turned into
"an unsubstantial faery place" by the magic of the cuckoo or the thrush,
strikes out playful theories of the professional methods of these
songsters,&mdash;the cuckoo's monopoly of the "minor third," the
thrush's wise way of repeating himself "lest you should think he never
could recapture his first fine careless rapture." Suffering enters
Browning's poetry almost never as the artless wail of the helpless
stricken thing; the intolerable pathos of <i>Ye Banks and Braes</i>, or
of</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"We twa hae paidl't in the burn<br />
      Frae morning sun till dine,"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">belonged to a side of primitive emotion to which
"artificial" poets like Tennyson were far more sensitive than he.
Suffering began to interest him when the wail passed into the
fierceness of vindictive passion, as in <a name="page282"
id="page282"><i>The Confessional</i></a>, or into the outward calm of a
self-subjugated spirit, as in <i>Any Wife to any Husband</i>, or <i>A
Woman's Last Word</i>; or into reflective and speculative, if bitter,
retrospect, as in <i>The Worst of It</i> or <i>James Lee's Wife</i>.
And happiness, equally,&mdash;even the lover's happiness,&mdash;needed,
to satisfy Browning, to have some leaven of challenging disquiet; the
lover must have something to fear, or something to forgive, some
hostility, or guilt, or absence, or death, to brave. Or the rapturous
union of lovers must be remembered with a pang, when they have
quarrelled; or its joy be sobered by recalling the perilous hairbreadth
chances incurred in achieving it (<i>By the Fireside</i>)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Oh, the little more, and how much it is!<br />
     <span class="in1">And the little less, and what worlds away!</span><br />
      How a sound shall quicken content to bliss,<br />
     <span class="in1">Or a breath suspend the blood's best play,</span><br />
     <span class="in3">And life be a proof of this!"</span></p>
</div>

<p>Further, his joy in soul drew into the sphere of his poetry large
tracts of existence which lay wholly or partly outside the domain of
soul itself. The world of the lower animals hardly touched the deeper
chords of his thought or emotion; but he watched their activities with
a very genuine and constant delight, and he took more account of their
pangs than he did of the soul-serving throes of man.<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref119" id="fnref119" href="#fn119">[119]</a></span>
His imaginative selection among the countless types of these "low
kinds" follows the lead of all those forms of primitive joy which we <a
name="page283" id="page283">have</a> traced in his types of men and
women: here it is the quick-glancing intricate flights of birds or
insects, the flitting of quick sandpipers in and out of the marl, or of
flies about an old wall; now the fierce contrasts of hue, angularity,
and grotesque deformity all at once in Caliban's beasts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"Yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech;<br />
      Yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam,<br />
      That floats and feeds; a certain badger brown<br />
      He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye<br />
      By moonlight;"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or it is the massive power of the desert lion, in
<i>The Glove</i> or the bright æthereal purity of the butterfly
fluttering over the swimmer's head, with its</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in2">"membraned wings</span><br />
      So wonderful, so wide,<br />
      So sun-suffused;"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref120" id="fnref120" href="#fn120">[120]</a></span></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or the cheery self-dependence of the solitary
insect. "I always love those wild creatures God sets up for
themselves," he wrote to Miss Barrett, "so independently, so
successfully, with their strange happy minute inch of a candle, as it
were, to light them."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref121"

<p>Finally, Browning's joy in soul flowed over also upon the host of
lifeless things upon which "soul" itself has in any way been spent. To
bear the mark of Man's art and toil, to have been hewn or moulded or
built, <a name="page284" id="page284">compounded</a> or taken to
pieces, by human handiwork, was to acquire a certain romantic
allurement for Browning's imagination hardly found in any other poet in
the same degree. The "artificial products" of civilised and cultured
life were for him not merely instruments of poetic expression but
springs of poetic joy. No poetry can dispense with images from
"artificial" things; Wordsworth himself does not always reject them;
with most poets they are commoner, merely because they are
better known; but for Browning the impress of "our meddling intellect"
added exactly the charm and stimulus which complete exemption from it
added for Wordsworth. His habitual imagery is fetched, not from flowers
or clouds or moving winds and waters, but from wine-cups, swords and
sheaths, lamps, tesselated pavements, chess-boards, pictures, houses,
ships, shops. Most of these appealed also to other instincts,&mdash;to
his joy in brilliant colour, abrupt line, intricate surface, or violent
emotion. But their "artificiality" was an added attraction. The wedge,
for instance, appeals to him not only by its angularity and its rending
thrust, but as a weapon contrived by man's wit and driven home by his
muscle. The cup appeals to him not only by its shape, and by the rush of
the foaming wine, but as fashioned by the potter's wheel, and flashing
at the festal board. His delight in complex technicalities, in the
tangled issues of the law-courts, and the intertwining harmonies of
Bach, sprang from his joy in the play of mind as well as from his joy in
mere intricacy as such. His mountains <a name="page285"
id="page285">are</a> gashed and cleft and carved not only because their
intricacy of craggy surface or the Titanic turmoil of
mountain-shattering delights him, but also because he loves
to suggest the deliberate axe or chisel of the warrior or the artist
Man. He turns the quiet vicissitudes of nature into dexterous
achievements of art. If he does not paint or dye the meads, he turns the
sunset clouds into a feudal castle, shattered slowly with a visible
mace; the morning sun pours into Pippa's chamber as from a wine-bowl;
and Fifine's ear is</p>

<p class="noindent">And thirty years later he used the kindred but more
recondite simile of a ring with its fortifying alloy, to symbolise the
welded <i>Wahrheit</i> and <i>Dichtung</i> of his greatest poem.</p>

<p>Between <i>Dichtung</i> and <i>Wahrheit</i> there was, indeed, in
Browning's mind, a closer affinity than that simile suggests. His
imagination was a factor in his apprehension of truth; his "poetry"
cannot be detached from his interpretation of life, nor his
interpretation of life from his poetry. Not that all parts of his
apparent <a name="page286" id="page286">teaching</a> belong equally to
his poetic mind. On the contrary, much of it was derived from traditions
of which he never shook himself clear; much from the exercise of a
speculative reason which, though incomparably agile, was neither well
disciplined in its methods nor particularly original in its grasp of
principles. But with the vitalising heart of his faith neither tradition
nor reasoning had so much to do as that logic of the imagination by
which great poets often implicitly enunciate what the after-thinker
slowly works out. The characteristic ways of Browning's poetry, the
fundamental joys on which it fed, of which the present chapter attempts
an account, by no means define the range or the limits of his
interpreting intellect, but they mark the course of its deepest
currents, the permanent channels which its tides overflow, but to which
in the last resort they return. In the following chapter we shall have
to study these fluctuating movements of his explicit and formulated
thought, and to distinguish, if we may, the ground-tone of the deep
waters from the more resonant roll of the shifting tides.</p>

<h4>THE INTERPRETER OF LIFE.</h4>

<div class="poem">
    <p>His voice sounds loudest and also clearest for the things that as a
    race we like best; ... the fascination of faith, the acceptance of
    life, the respect for its mysteries, the endurance of its charges,
    the vitality of the will, the validity of character, the beauty of
    action, the seriousness, above all, of great human passion.<br />
    <span class="in20">&mdash;</span><span class="small">HENRY JAMES.</span></p>
</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The trend of speculative thought in Europe during
the century which preceded the emergence of Browning may be described
as a progressive integration along several distinct lines of the great
regions of existence which common beliefs, resting on a still vigorous
medievalism, thrust apart. Nature was brought into nearer relation with
Man, and Man with God, and God with Nature and with Man. In one aspect,
not the least striking, it was a "return to Nature"; economists from
Adam Smith to Malthus worked out the laws of man's dependence upon the
material world; poets and idealists from Rousseau to Wordsworth
discovered in a <a name="page288" id="page288">life</a> "according to
nature" the ideal for man; sociologists from Hume to Bentham, and from
Burke to Coleridge, applied to human society conceptions derived from
physics or from biology, and emphasised all that connects it with the
mechanical aggregate of atoms, or with the organism.</p>

<p>In another aspect it was a return to God. If the scientific movement
tended to subjugate man to a Nature in which, as Laplace said, there was
no occasion for God, Wordsworth saw both in Nature and in man a spirit
"deeply interfused"; and the great contemporary school of German
philosophy set all ethical thinking in a new perspective by its original
handling of the old thesis that duty is a realisation of the will of
God.</p>

<p>But, in yet another aspect, it was a return to Man. If Man was
brought nearer to Nature and to God, it was to a Nature and to a God
which had themselves acquired, for him, closer affinities with
humanity. He divined, with Wordsworth, his own joy, with Shelley his
own love, in the breathing flower; he saw with Hegel in the Absolute
Spirit a power vitally present in all man's secular activities and
pursuits. And these interpreting voices of poets and philosophers were
but the signs of less articulate sensibilities far more widely
diffused, which were in effect bringing about a manifold expansion and
enrichment of normal, mental, and emotional life. Scott made the
romantic past, Byron and Goethe, in their different ways, the Hellenic
past, a living element of the present; and Fichte, calling upon his <a
name="page289" id="page289">countrymen</a> to emancipate
themselves, in the name not of the "rights of men" but of the genius of
the German people, uttered the first poignant recognition of national
life as a glorious vesture arraying the naked body of the individual
member, not an aggregate of other units competing with or controlling
him.</p>

<p>In this complicated movement Browning played a very notable and
memorable part. But it was one of which the first generation of his
readers was entirely, and he himself to a great extent, unconscious, and
which his own language often disguises or conceals. Of all the poets of
the century he had the clearest and most confident vision of the working
of God in the world, the most buoyant faith in the divine origin and
destiny of man. Half his poetry is an effort to express, in endless
variety of iteration, the nearness of God, to unravel the tangled
circumstance of human life, and disclose everywhere infinity enmeshed
amid the intricacies of the finite.</p>

<p>On the side of Nature his interest was less keen and his vision less
subtle. His "visitations of the living God" came to him by other avenues
than those opened by Wordsworth's ecstatic gaze, "in love and holy
passion," upon outward beauty. Only limited classes of natural phenomena
appealed to him powerfully at all, the swift and sudden upheavals and
catastrophes, the ardours and accesses, the silence that thrills with
foreboding and suspense. For continuities, both of the mechanical and
the organic kind, he lacked sense. <a name="page290"
id="page290">We</a> have seen how his eye fastened
everywhere upon the aspects of life least suggestive of either iron
uniformity or harmonious evolution. The abrupt demarcations which he
everywhere imposes or discovers were the symptom of a primitive
ingrained atomism of thought which all the synthetic strivings of a
God-intoxicated intellect could not entirely overcome.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>His metaphysical thinking thus became an effort to reconcile an
all-embracing synthesis with a sense of individuality as stubborn and
acute as ever man had. Body and Soul, Nature and Spirit, Man and God,
Good and Evil, he presented now as co-operative or alien, now as hostile
antagonists or antitheses. That their opposition is not ultimate, that
evil is at bottom a form of good, and all finite existence a passing
mode of absolute being, was a conviction towards which his thought on
one side constantly strove, which it occasionally touched, but in which
it could not securely rest. Possessed by the thirst for absoluteness, he
vindicated the "infinity" of God and the soul by banishing all the
"finiteness" of sense into a limbo of illusion. The infinite soul,
imprisoned for life in a body which at every moment clogs its motion and
dims its gaze, fights its way through the shows of sense,<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref124" id="fnref124" href="#fn124">[124]</a></span>
"which ever proving false still promise to be <a name="page291"
id="page291">true</a>," until death opens the
prison-gate and restores the captive to its infinity. Sorrow and evil
were stains imposed by Time upon the white radiance of an eternal being;
and Browning sometimes rose, though with a less sure step, to the
dizzier height of holding Time itself to be unreal, and the soul's
earthly life not an episode in an endless sequence, but a dream of
progressive change imposed upon a changeless and timeless essence.</p>

<p>But there were, as has been said, elements in Browning's mental make
which kept this abstract and formal theory, fortified though it was by
theological prepossessions, in check. His most intense consciousness,
his most definite grip upon reality, was too closely bound up with the
collisions and jostlings, the limits and angularities, of the world of
the senses, for the belief in their illusoriness easily to hold its
ground. This "infinite soul" palpably had its fullest and richest
existence in the very heart of finite things. Wordsworth had turned for
"intimations of immortality" to the remembered intuitions of childhood;
Browning found them in every pang of baffled aspiration and frustrate
will. Hence there arose in the very midst of this realm of illusion a
new centre of reality; the phantoms took on solid and irrefragable
existence, and refused to take to flight when the cock-crow announced
that "Time was done, Eternity begun."</p>

<p>Body and Time had in general too strong a grip upon him to be
resolved into illusion. His actual <a name="page292"
id="page292">pictures</a> of departed souls suggest a state
very unlike that reversion of the infinite spirit which had been thrust
upon Matter and distended in Time, to the timeless Infinitude it had
forgone. It does not escape from Time, but only passes on from the
limited section of Time known as life, into another section, without
limit, known as Eternity. And if it escapes from Body, at least Browning
represents his departed soul more boldly than any other modern poet in a
garb of flesh. Evelyn Hope, when she wakens in another world, will find
her unknown lover's leaf in her hand, and "remember, and understand."</p>

<p>And just as Matter and Time invade Browning's spiritual eternity, so
his ideal of conduct for man while still struggling with finite
conditions casts its shadow on to the state of immortal release. Two
conceptions, in fact, of the life after death, corresponding to
divergent aspects of his thought, contend in Browning's mind. Now it is
a state of emancipation from earthly limits,&mdash;when the "broken
arcs" become "perfect rounds" and "evil" is transformed into "so much
good more," and "reward and repose" succeed the "struggles"<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref125" id="fnref125" href="#fn125">[125]</a></span>
by which they have been won. But at times he startles the devout reader
by foreshadowing not a sudden transformation but a continuation of the
slow educative process of earth in a succession of preliminary heavens
before the consummate state is reached. "Progress," in short, was too
deeply <a name="page293" id="page293">ingrained</a> in Browning's
conception of what was ultimately good, and therefore ultimately real,
not to find entrance into his heaven, were it only by some casual
backdoor of involuntary intuition. Even in that more gracious state
"achievement lacked a gracious somewhat"<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref126" id="fnref126" href="#fn126">[126]</a></span> to his
indomitable fighting instinct.</p>

<p class="noindent">he had said in <i>Pauline</i>, and the soul that
ceased to advance ceased for Browning, in his most habitual mood, to
exist. The "infinity" of the soul was not so much a gift as a destiny,
a power of hungering for ever after an ideal completeness which it was
indefinitely to pursue and to approach, but not to reach. Far from
having to await a remote emancipation to become completely itself, the
soul's supremest life was in its hours of heroic stress, when it kept
some dragon of unbelief quiet underfoot, like Michael,</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p class="noindent">It was at this point that the athletic energy of
Browning's nature told most palpably upon the complexion of his
thought. It did not affect its substance, but it altered the bearing of
the parts, giving added weight to all its mundane and positive
elements. It gave value to every challenging obstruction akin to that
which allured him to every angular and broken surface, to all the
"evil" which balks our easy perception of "good."<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref127" id="fnref127" href="#fn127">[127]</a></span> <a
name="page294" id="page294">Above</a> all, by idealising effort, it
created a new ethical end which every strenuous spirit could not merely
strive after but fulfil, every day of its mortal life; and thus
virtually transferred the focus of interest and importance from "the
next world's reward and repose" to the vital "struggles in this."</p>

<p>Browning's characteristic conception of the nature and destiny of man
was thus not a compact and consistent system, but a group of intuitions
nourished from widely different regions of soul and sense, and
undergoing, like the face of a great actor, striking changes of
expression without material change of feature under the changing
incidence of stress and glow. The ultimate gist of his teaching was
presented through the medium of conceptions proper to another school of
thought, which, like a cryptogram, convey one meaning but express
another, He had to work with categories like finite and infinite, which
the atomic habits of his mind thrust into exclusive opposition; whereas
the profoundest thing that he had to say was that the "infinite" has to
be achieved in and through the finite, that just the most definitely
outlined action, the most individual purpose, the most sharply
expressive thought, the most intense and personal passion, are the
points or saliency in life which most surely catch the radiance of
eternity they break. The white light was "blank" until shattered by
refraction; and Browning is less Browning when he glories in its
unbroken purity than when he rejoices in the prism, whose obstruction
alone</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Beside the soul, there was something else that "stood sure" for
Browning&mdash;namely, God. Here, too, a theological dogma, steeped in
his ardent mind, acquired a new potency for the imagination, and a more
vital nexus with man and nature than any other poet of the century had
given it. And here, too, the mystic and the positive strains of
Browning's genius wrought together, impressing themselves equally in
that wonderful Browningesque universe in which every germ seems to be
itself a universe "needing but a look to burst into immense life," and
infinity is ever at hand, behind a closed door. The whole of his
theology was an attempt to express consistently two convictions, rarely
found of the same intensity in the same brain, of the divineness of the
universe and the individuality of man.</p>

<p>The mechanical Creator of Paley and the deists could never have
satisfied him. From the first he "saw God <a name="page296"
id="page296">everywhere</a>." There was in him the stuff of which the
"God-intoxicated" men are made, and he had moments, like that expressed
in one of his most deliberate and emphatic personal utterances, in
which all existence seemed to be the visible Face of God&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">He clearly strained towards the sublime pantheistic
imaginings of the great poets of the previous
generation,&mdash;Wordsworth's "Something far more deeply interfused,"
Shelley's "One spirit's plastic stress," and Goethe's <i>Erdgeist</i>,
who weaves the eternal vesture of God at the loom
of Time. The dying vision of Paracelsus is as sublime as these, and
marks Browning's nearest point of approach to the ways of thought they
embody. In all the vitalities of the world, from the uncouth play of the
volcano to the heaven-and-earth transfiguring mind of man, God was
present, sharing their joy. But even here the psychological barrier is
apparent, against which all the surge of pantheistic impulse in Browning
broke in vain. This God of manifold joys was sharply detached from his
universe; he was a sensitive and sympathetic spectator, not a pervading
spirit. In every direction human personality opposed rigid frontiers
which even the infinite God could not pass, and no poet less needed the
stern warning which he addressed to German speculation against the
"gigantic stumble"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref131" id="fnref131"
href="#fn131">[131]</a></span> of <a name="page297"
id="page297">making</a> them one. The mystic's dream of
seeing all things in God, the Hegelian thesis of a divine mind realising
itself in and through the human, found no lodgment in a consciousness of
mosaic-like clearness dominated by the image of an incisively individual
and indivisible self. In later life the sharp lines which he drew from
the first about individual personality became a ring-fence within which
each man "cultivated his plot,"<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref132"

he might the business of his soul. The divine love might wind

amid the welter of the waves.<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref135"
id="fnref135" href="#fn135">[135]</a></span> His love might be a "spark

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>In this sharp demarcation of man's being from God's, Browning never
faltered. On the contrary, the individualising animus which there found
expression impelled him to raise more formidable barriers about man, and
to turn the ring-fence which secured him from intrusion into a high wall
which cut off his view. In other words, the main current of Browning's
thought <a name="page298" id="page298">sets</a> strongly towards a
sceptical criticism of human knowledge. At the outset he stands on the
high <i>à priori</i> ground of Plato. Truth in its fulness abides in
the soul, an "imprisoned splendour," which intellect quickened by love
can elicit, which moments of peculiar insight, deep joy, and sorrow,
and the coming on of death, can release. But the gross flesh hems it
in, wall upon wall, "a baffling and perverting carnal mesh,"<span
class="fnref"><a name="fnref137" id="fnref137" href="#fn137">[137]</a></span>
the source of all error. The process of discovery he commonly conceived
as an advance through a succession of Protean disguises of truth, each
"one grade above its last presentment,"<span class="fnref"><a
name="fnref138" id="fnref138" href="#fn138">[138]</a></span> until, at
the rare moment, by the excepted eye, the naked truth was grasped. But
Browning became steadily more reluctant to admit that these fortunate
moments ever occurred, that the Proteus was ever caught. Things would
be known to the soul as they were known to God only when it was
emancipated by death. Infinity receded into an ever more inaccessible
remoteness from the finite. For the speaker in <i>Christmas-Eve</i>
man's mind was the image of God's, reflecting trace for trace his
absolute knowledge; for Francis Furini the bare fact of his own
existence is all he knows, a narrow rock-spit of knowledge enisled
in a trackless ocean of ignorance. Thus for Browning, in differing moods
and contexts, the mind of man becomes now a transparent pane, opening
directly upon the truth as God sees it, now a coloured lens, <a
name="page299" id="page299">presenting</a> truth in blurred refraction,
now an opaque mirror idly bodying forth his futile and illusive dreams.</p>

</div>

<p>These conflicting views were rooted in different elements of
Browning's many-sided nature. His vivid intuition of his own
self-consciousness formed a standing type of seemingly absolute
immediate knowledge, to which he stubbornly clung. When the optimism of
the "Head" was discredited, passion-fraught instinct, under the name of
the Heart, came to the rescue, and valiantly restored its authority. On
the other hand, a variety of subtle attractions drew him on to give
"illusion" a wider and wider scope. Sheer joy in battle had no small
share. The immortal and infinite soul, projected among the shows of
sense, could not be expected to do its part worthily if it saw through
them: it had to believe its enemies real enemies, and its warfare a
rational warfare; it had to accept time and place, and good and evil,
as the things they seem. To have a perfectly clear vision of truth as
it is in God was to be dazzled with excess of light, to grope and
fumble about the world as it is for man, like the risen Lazarus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
      <p><span class="in2">"witless of the size, the sum,</span><br />
      The value in proportion of all things,<br />
      Or whether it be little or be much."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The mystic who withdrew from the struggle with
phantoms to gaze upon eternal realities was himself the victim of the
worst illusions; while the hero who <a name="page300"
id="page300">plunged</a> into that struggle was training his soul, and
thereby getting a grip upon ultimate truth. Thus Browning's passionate
and reiterated insistence upon the illusiveness of knowledge was rooted
in his inalienable faith in the worth and reality of moral conflict. The
infinite soul realised itself most completely when it divested itself of
the trappings of its infinity, and it worked out God's law most
implicitly when it ignored God's point of view.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Such a result could not be finally satisfying, and Browning's thought
fastened with increasing predilection and exclusiveness upon one intense
kind of vitality in which the hard antagonism of good and evil seems to
be transcended, and that complete immersion of the soul in a nature not
its own appears not as self-abnegation but as self-fulfilment. He did
not himself use this phraseology about Love; it is that of a school to
which he, at no time, it would seem, made any conscious approach. But it
is clear that he found in the mysterious union and transfusion of
diverse being which takes place in Love, as Hegel found in the union of
opposites, the clue to the nature of reality, the very core of the heart
of life. He did not talk of the union of opposites, but of "infinitude
wreaking itself upon the finite." God himself would have been less
divine, and so, as God, less real, had he remained aloof in lonely
infinity instead of uniting himself with all creation in that love
which "<a name="page301" id="page301">moves</a> the world and the other
stars"; the "loving worm," to quote his pregnant saying once more, were
diviner than a loveless God. We saw how his theology is double-faced
between the pantheistic yearning to find God everywhere and the
individualist's resolute maintenance of the autonomy of man. God's
Love, poured through the world, inextricably blended with all its power
and beauty, thrilled with answering rapture by all its joy, and
striving to clasp every human soul, provided the nearest approach to a
solution of that conflict which Browning's mechanical metaphysics
permitted. One comprehends, then, the profound significance for him of
the actual solution apparently presented by Christian theology. In one
supreme, crucial example the union of God with man in consummate love
had actually, according to Christian belief, taken place, and Browning
probably uttered his own faith when he made St John declare that</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p class="quote">"The acknowledgment of God in Christ<br />
      Acknowledged by thy reason solves for thee<br />
      All questions in the earth and out of it."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref139" id="fnref139" href="#fn139">[139]</a></span></p>
</div>

<div class="fn">
<span class="fnnum"><a name="fn139" id="fn139" href="#fnref139">[139]</a></span>
<i>Death in the Desert</i>. These lines, however "dramatic,"
mark with precision the extent, and the limits, of Browning's Christian
faith. The evidence of his writings altogether confirms Mrs Orr's
express statement that Christ was for him, from first to last, "a
manifestation of divine love," by human form accessible to human love;
but not the Redeemer of the orthodox creed.
</div>

<p>For to acknowledge this was to recognise that love was divine, and
that mankind at large, in virtue of their gift of love, shared in God's
nature, finite as they were; that <a name="page302"
id="page302">whatever</a> clouds of intellectual illusion they walked
in, they were lifted to a hold upon reality as unassailable as God's
own by the least glimmer of love. Whatever else is obscure or elusive
in Browning, he never falters in proclaiming the absolute and flawless
worth of love. The lover cannot, like the scientific investigator, miss
his mark, he cannot be baffled or misled; the object of his love may be
unworthy, or unresponsive, but in the mere act of loving he has his
reward.</p>

      <p><span class="in6">"Knowledge means</span><br />

<p class="noindent">This aspect of Browning's doctrine of love, though
it inspired some of his most exalted lyrics, throws into naked relief
the dearth of social consciousness in Browning's psychology. Yet it is
easy to see that the absolute self-sufficiency into which he lifted the
bare fact of love was one of the mainsprings of his indomitable
optimism. In Love was concentrated all that emancipates man from the
stubborn continuities of Nature. It started up in corrupt or sordid
hearts, and swept all their blind velleities into its purifying flame
of passion&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

only the most intense and potent of those sudden accesses of vitality
which are wont, in Browning, suddenly to break like a flame from the
straw and dross of a brutish or sophisticated consciousness,
confounding foresight and calculation, but giving endless stimulus to
hope. Even in the contact with sin and sorrow Browning saw simply the
touch of Earth from which Love, like Antaeus, sprang into fuller being;
they were the "dread machinery" devised to evolve man's moral
qualities, "to make him love in turn and be beloved."<span

<p>But with all its insurgent emancipating vehemence Love was for
Browning, also, the very ground of stable and harmonious existence,
"the energy of integration," as Myers has finely said, "which makes a
cosmos of the sum of things," the element of permanence, of law. True,
its harmony was of the kind which admits discord and eschews routine;
its law that which is of eternity and not of yesterday; its stability
that which is only assured and fortified by the chivalry that plucks a
Pompilia, or an Alcestis, from their legal doom. The true anarchist, as
he sometimes dared to hint, was the cold unreason of duty which, as in
<i>Bifurcation</i>, keeps lovers meant for each other apart. It is by
love that the soul solves the problem&mdash;so tragically insoluble to
poor Sordello&mdash;of "fitting to the finite its infinity," and
satisfying the needs of Time and Eternity at once;<span

<p class="noindent">In a life thus thrilled into harmony heaven was
already realised on earth; and Eternity itself could but continue what
Time had begun. Death, for such a soul, was not an awaking, for it had
not slept; nor an emancipation, for it was already free; nor a
satisfying of desire, for the essence of Love was to want; it was only
a point at which the "last ride together" might pass into an eternal
"riding on"&mdash;</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>No intellectual formula, no phrase, no word, can express the whole
purport of those intense and intimate fusions of sensation, passion, and
thought which we call poetic intuition, and which all strictly poetic
"philosophy" or "criticism of life" is an attempt to interpret and
articulate. Browning was master of more potent weapons <a
name="page305" id="page305">of</a> the strictly intellectual kind than
many poets of his rank, and his work is charged with convictions which
bear upon philosophic problems and involve philosophic ideas. But they
were neither systematic deductions from a speculative first principle
nor fragments of tradition eclectically pieced together; by their very
ambiguity and Protean many-sidedness they betrayed that, however tinged
they might be on the surface with speculative or traditional phrases,
the nourishing roots sprang from the heart of joyous vitality in a
primitive and original temperament. In Browning, if in any man, Joy
sang that "strong music of the soul" which re-creates all the
vitalities of the world, and endows us with "a new Earth and a new
Heaven." And if joy was the root of Browning's intuition, and life "in
widest commonalty spread" the element in which it moved, Love, the most
intimate, intense, and marvellous of all vital energies, was the ideal
centre towards which it converged. In Love, as Browning understood it,
all those elementary joys of his found satisfaction. There he saw the
flawless purity which rejoiced him in Pompilia's soul, which "would not
take pollution, ermine-like armed from dishonour by its own soft snow."
There he saw sudden incalculableness of power abruptly shattering the
continuities of routine, throwing life instantly into a new
perspective, and making barren trunks break into sudden luxuriance like
the palm; or, again, intimately interpenetrating soul with
soul,&mdash;"one near one is too far"; or <a name="page306"
id="page306">entangling</a> the whole creation in the inextricable
embrace of God.</p>

<p>But if all his instincts and imaginative proclivities found their
ideal in Love, they also insensibly impressed their own character upon
his conception of it. The "Love" which has so deep a significance for
Browning is a Love steeped in the original complexion of his mind, and
bearing the impress of the singular position which he occupies in the
welter of nineteenth-century intellectual history. His was one of the
rare natures in which revolutionary liberalism and spiritual reaction,
encountering in nearly equal strength, seem to have divided their
principles and united their forces. Psychologically, the one had its
strongest root in the temper which reasons, and values ideas; the other
in that which feels, and values emotions. Sociologically, the one stood
for individualism, the other for solidarity. In their ultimate
presuppositions, the one inclined to the standpoint of the senses and
experience; the other to a mostly vague and implicit idealism. In their
political ideals, the one strove for progress, and for freedom as its
condition; the other for order, and for active legal intervention as its
safeguard.</p>

<p>In two of these four points of contrast, Browning's temperament
ranged him more or less decisively on the Liberal side. Individualist
to the core, he was conspicuously deficient in the kind of social mind
which makes a poet the voice of an organised community, a nation, or a
class. Progress, again, was with him even <a name="page307"
id="page307">more</a> an instinct than a principle; and he became the
<i>vates sacer</i> of unsatisfied aspiration. On the other
hand, that he was not without elements of the temper which makes for
order was shown by his punctilious, almost eager, observance of social
conventions, and, in the last years of his life, by the horror excited
in him by what he took to be the anarchy of Women's Suffrage and Home
Rule. In the other two fields of opposition he belonged decisively to
the spiritual and emotional reaction. Spirit was for him the ultimate
fact of existence, the soul and God were the indissoluble realities. But
his idealism was not potent and pure enough either to control the
realist suggestions of his strong senses and energetic temperament, or
to interpret them in its own terms. And in the conflict between reason
and feeling, or, as he put it, between "head" and "heart," as sources of
insight, and factors in human advancement, feeling found its most
brilliant champion in Browning, and its most impressive statement in his
doctrine of Love. An utilitarian reduction of welldoing to a
distribution of properly calculated doses of satisfaction he dismissed
with a scorn as derisive as Carlyle's; "general utility" was a favourite
of "that old stager the devil."<span class="fnref"><a name="fnref145"
id="fnref145" href="#fn145">[145]</a></span> Yet no critic of intellect
ever used intellect more vigorously, and no preacher of the rights of
the heart ever dealt less in flaccid sentiment. Browning was Paracelsus
as well as Aprile, and sharply as he chose to dissever "Knowledge" and
"Love," Love was for him never a foe of intellect, <a name="page308"
id="page308">but</a> a more gifted comrade who does the same work more
effectively, who dives deeper, soars higher, welds more potently into
more enduring unities, and flings upon dry hearts with a more
infallible magic the seed of more marvellous new births. Browning as
the poet of Love is thus the last, and assuredly not the least, in the
line which handed on the torch of Plato. The author of the
<i>Phoedrus</i> saw in the ecstasy of Love one of the avenues to the
knowledge of the things that indeed are. To Dante the supreme realities
were mirrored in the eyes of Beatrice. For Shelley Love was interwoven
through all the mazes of Being; it was the source of the strength by
which man masters his gods. To all these masters of idealism Browning's
vision of Love owed something of its intensity and of its range. With
the ethical Love of Jesus and St Paul his affinities were more apparent,
but less profound. For him, too, love was the sum of all morality and
the root of all goodness. But it resembled more the joyous
self-expansion of the Greek than the humility and self-abnegation of
Christian love. Not the saintly ascetic nor the doer of good works, but
the artist and the "lover," dominated his imagination when he wrote of
Love; imbuing even God's love for the world with the joy of creation and
the rapture of embrace. Aprile's infinite love for things impelled him
to body them visibly forth. Deeper in Browning than his Christianity,
and prior to it, lay his sense of immeasurable worth in all life, the
poet's passion for being.</p>

<p>Browning's poetry is thus one of the most potent of the influences
which in the nineteenth century helped to break down the shallow and
mischievous distinction between the "sacred" and the "secular," and to
set in its place the profounder division between man enslaved by apathy,
routine, and mechanical morality, and man lifted by the law of love into
a service which is perfect freedom, into an approximation to God which
is only the fullest realisation of humanity.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
